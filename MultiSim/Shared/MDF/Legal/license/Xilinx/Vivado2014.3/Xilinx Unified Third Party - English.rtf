\line

\line
Part One: Overview.\line
\line
The following information applies to certain items of third-party technology that are included along with certain Xilinx software tools.\line
\line
The Xilinx Embedded Development Kit (EDK) is a suite of software and other technology that enables Licensee to design a complete embedded processor system for use in a Xilinx Device.  EDK includes, among other components, (a) the Xilinx Platform Studio (XPS), which is the development environment, or GUI, used for designing the hardware portion of an embedded processor system; and (b) the Xilinx Software Development Kit (SDK), which is an integrated development environment, complementary to XPS, that is used to create and verify C/C++ embedded software applications.  SDK is also made available separately from EDK.\line
 \line
Licensee's use of the GNU compilers (including associated libraries and utilities) that are supplied with SDK may cause Licensee's software application (or board-support package) to be governed by certain third-party "open source" license agreements, as further described below.  Licensee can avoid this result by using alternative compilers, libraries, and utilities of its own choosing in lieu of the GNU compilers (and associated libraries and utilities) supplied with SDK. \line
 \line
First:  Xilinx provides three types of software drivers: (a) stand-alone drivers, (b) VxWorks drivers, and (c) Linux drivers.  The Linux drivers are made available under the terms of the GNU GPL and are subject to that license.\line
 \line
Second:  Compiling (i.e., used for C/C++ code/drivers) with the GNU compilers will add certain "newlib" utilities to Licensee's software application.  The specific utility or utilities chosen by the Licensee will be covered under one or more of the various licenses set forth in the collection of "newlib" licenses described below. \line
 \line
Third:  Compiling (i.e., used for C/C++ code/drivers) with the GNU compilers adds certain "start up" code to Licensee's software application.  This "start up" code may be covered under the GNU LGPL, or, alternatively, there may be other license terms (including possible exceptions or exemptions from certain obligations of the GNU licenses) governing such "start up" code which would be contained or described in the header files or other accompanying source files for such "start up" code. \line
 \line
Fourth:  If the Licensee chooses to use the LWIP stack, the LWIP code becomes part of Licensee's software application.  The LWIP code is covered by a license described below.\line
 \line
Note:  Licensee is solely responsible for checking the header files and other accompanying source files of all software applications created from the use of the GNU compliers (and associated libraries and utilities) that are supplied with SDK because such header and/or source files may contain or describe various copyright notices and license terms and conditions governing such files, which vary from case to case based on Licensee's usage and are beyond the control of Xilinx.  This summary and the license information provided below is for reference purposes and is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all copyright notices or third-party license terms and conditions applicable to SDK.  Licensee is solely responsible for complying with the terms and conditions imposed by third parties as applicable to the Licensee's software applications created from the use of the GNU compilers (and associated libraries and utilities) that are supplied with SDK.\line
 \line
\line
The remainder of this document is organized into various parts, as follows:\line
\line
Part Two: Licensee Redistributable Content.\line
     Index:\line
     Licenses and Notices:\line
\line
Part Two contains a list of notices, licenses and/or other information related to certain items of third-party technology that Xilinx has identified and categorized as "Licensee Redistributable Content", which means that Xilinx has included this third-party technology with the Xilinx Software for the purpose of enabling a Xilinx customer to distribute it (or a portion of it, or a derivative form of it) as part of such customer's design or product.  \line
\line
Part Three: Other Third-Party Content.\line
     Index:\line
     Licenses and Notices:\line
\line
Part Three contains a list of additional notices, licenses and/or other information related to certain items of third-party technology other than as provided in Part Two.  Please note that by listing certain items in this Part Three as opposed to Part Two above, Xilinx does not abrogate or diminish in any respect either its own obligations, or Licensee's rights (if and as may be applicable), with respect to the (present or future) distribution of such items.  With respect to any license that requires Xilinx to make available to recipients of object code distributed by Xilinx pursuant to such license the corresponding source code, and if you desire to receive such source code from Xilinx and cannot access the internet to obtain a copy thereof, then Xilinx hereby offers (which offer is valid for as long as required by the applicable license; and we may charge you the cost thereof unless prohibited by the license) to provide you with a copy of such source code; and to accept such offer send a letter requesting such source code (please be specific by identifying the particular Xilinx Software you are inquiring about (name and version number), to:  Xilinx, Inc., Legal Department, Attention: Software Compliance Officer, 2100 Logic Drive, San Jose, CA U.S.A. 95124.\line

basic inverse-DCT transformation subroutine. This implementation is based on an\line
algorithm described in C. Loeffler, A. Ligtenberg and G. Moschytz, "Practical\line
Fast 1-D DCT Algorithms with 11 Multiplications", Proc. Int'l. Conf. on\line
Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing 1989 (ICASSP '89), pp. 988-991. The\line
primary algorithm described there uses 11 multiplies and 29 adds. We use their\line
alternate method with 12 multiplies and 32 adds. The advantage of this method is\line
that no data path contains more than one multiplication; this allows a very\line
simple and accurate implementation in scaled fixed-point arithmetic, with a\line
minimal number of shifts. I've made lots of modifications to attempt to take\line
advantage of the sparse nature of the DCT matrices we're getting. Although the\line
logic is cumbersome, it's straightforward and the resulting code is much faster.\line
A better way to do this would be to pass in the DCT block as a sparse matrix,\line
perhaps with the difference cases encoded. / @file Independent JPEG Group's LLM\line

The FreeRTOS GPL Exception Text:\line
\line
Any FreeRTOS source code, whether modified or in it's original release form,\line

of the GNU General Public License plus this exception. An independent module is\line
a module which is not derived from or based on FreeRTOS.\line

Clause 1:\line
\line
Linking FreeRTOS statically or dynamically with other modules is making a\line
combined work based on FreeRTOS. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU\line

these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting combined\line
work under terms of your choice, provided that\line
\line
  + Every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a written statement that\line

  made) should the recipient request it.\line
\line
  + The combined work is not itself an RTOS, scheduler, kernel or related product.\line

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line
		       Version 2, June 1991\line
\line
 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\line
                       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA\line
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\line
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\line
\line
			    Preamble\line
\line
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\line
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\line
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\line
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\line
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software\line
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\line
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\line
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\line
your programs, too.\line
\line
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\line
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\line
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\line
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\line
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\line
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\line
\line
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\line
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\line
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\line
\line
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\line
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\line
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\line
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\line
rights.\line
\line
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\line
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\line
distribute and/or modify the software.\line
\line
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\line
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\line
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\line
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\line
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\line
authors' reputations.\line
\line
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\line
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\line
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\line
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\line
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\line
\line
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line
modification follow.\line
\line
\line
		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line
\line
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\line
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\line
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,\line
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"\line
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\line
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\line
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\line
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\line
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".\line
\line
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\line
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\line
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\line
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\line
\line
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\line
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\line
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\line
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\line
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\line
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\line
along with the Program.\line
\line
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\line
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\line
\line
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\line
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\line
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line
\line
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\line
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line
\line
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\line
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\line
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\line
    parties under the terms of this License.\line
\line
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\line
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\line
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\line
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\line
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\line
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\line
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\line
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\line
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\line
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\line
\line
\line
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\line
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\line
\line
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line
collective works based on the Program.\line
\line
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\line
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\line
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line
the scope of this License.\line
\line
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\line
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\line
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\line
\line
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\line
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\line
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\line
\line
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\line
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\line
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\line
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\line
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\line
    customarily used for software interchange; or,\line
\line
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\line
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\line
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\line
    received the program in object code or executable form with such\line
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\line
\line
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\line
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\line
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\line
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\line
special exception, the source code distributed need not include\line
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\line
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\line
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\line
itself accompanies the executable.\line
\line
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\line
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\line
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as\line
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\line
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line
\line
\line
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\line
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\line
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\line
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\line
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\line
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\line
parties remain in full compliance.\line
\line
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\line
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\line
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line
the Program or works based on it.\line
\line
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\line
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\line
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\line
this License.\line
\line
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\line
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\line
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\line
\line
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\line
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\line
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\line
circumstances.\line
\line
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is\line
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\line
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line
impose that choice.\line
\line
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line
be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line
\line
\line
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\line
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License\line
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\line
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\line
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\line
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\line
\line
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\line
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\line
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\line
address new problems or concerns.\line
\line
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\line
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any\line
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\line
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free\line
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\line
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\line
Foundation.\line
\line
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\line
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\line
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\line
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\line
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\line
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\line
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\line
\line
			    NO WARRANTY\line
\line
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\line
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\line
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\line
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\line
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\line
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\line
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\line
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\line
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line
\line
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\line
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\line
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\line
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\line
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\line

\line
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line
\line
\line
	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\line
\line
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\line
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\line
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\line
\line
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\line
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\line
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\line
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\line
\line
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\line
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\line
\line
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\line
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License** as published by\line
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\line
    (at your option) any later version.\line
\line
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\line
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\line
    GNU General Public License for more details.\line
\line
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\line
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\line
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA\line
\line
\line
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\line
\line
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\line
when it starts in an interactive mode:\line
\line
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\line
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\line
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\line
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\line
\line
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\line
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\line
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\line
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\line
\line
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\line
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if\line
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\line
\line
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\line
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\line
\line
  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\line
  Ty Coon, President of Vice\line
\line
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\line
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\line
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\line
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General\line
Public License instead of this License.\line
\line

\line
The FreeRTOS GPL Exception Text:\line
\line
Any FreeRTOS source code, whether modified or in it's original release form,\line
or whether in whole or in part, can only be distributed by you under the terms\line
of the GNU General Public License plus this exception. An independent module is\line
a module which is not derived from or based on FreeRTOS.\line
\line
Clause 1:\line
\line
Linking FreeRTOS statically or dynamically with other modules is making a\line
combined work based on FreeRTOS. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU\line
General Public License cover the whole combination.\line
\line
As a special exception, the copyright holder of FreeRTOS gives you permission\line
to link FreeRTOS with independent modules that communicate with FreeRTOS\line
solely through the FreeRTOS API interface, regardless of the license terms of\line
these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting combined\line
work under terms of your choice, provided that\line
\line
  + Every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a written statement that\line
  details to the recipient the version of FreeRTOS used and an offer by yourself\line
  to provide the FreeRTOS source code (including any modifications you may have\line
  made) should the recipient request it.\line
\line
  + The combined work is not itself an RTOS, scheduler, kernel or related product.\line
\line
  + The independent modules add significant and primary functionality to FreeRTOS\line
  and do not merely extend the existing functionality already present in FreeRTOS.\line
\line
Clause 2:\line
\line
FreeRTOS may not be used for any competitive or comparative purpose, including the\line
publication of any form of run time or compile time metric, without the express\line
permission of Real Time Engineers Ltd. (this is the norm within the industry and\line
is intended to ensure information accuracy).\line

This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December 31 2002. This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this license can be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, reflects that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use". Otherwise, this version is the same as the previous version and is written so as to preserve the Free Software Foundation's assessment of GPL compatibility and OSI's certification under the Open Source Definition\line

This code is a modified version of crypting code in Infozip distribution\line
The encryption/decryption parts of this source code (as opposed to the\line
non-echoing password parts) were originally written in Europe.  The\line
whole source package can be freely distributed, including from the USA.\line
(Prior to January 2000, re-export from the US was a violation of US law.)\line
This encryption code is a direct transcription of the algorithm from\line
Roger Schlafly, described by Phil Katz in the file appnote.txt.  This\line
file (appnote.txt) is distributed with the PKZIP program (even in the\line
version without encryption capabilities).\line

the libpng license. For conditions of distribution and use, see the disclaimer\line
and license in png.h / Define PNG_DEBUG at compile time for debugging\line
information. Higher numbers for PNG_DEBUG mean more debugging information. This\line
has only been added since version 0.95 so it is not implemented throughout\line
libpng yet, but more support will be added as needed. png_debug[1-2]?(level,\line
message ,arg\{0-2\}) Expands to a statement (either a simple expression or a\line
compound do..while(0) statement) that outputs a message with parameter\line
substitution if PNG_DEBUG is defined to 2 or more. If PNG_DEBUG is undefined, 0\line
or 1 every png_debug expands to a simple expression (actually ((void)0)). level:\line
level of detail of message, starting at 0. A level 'n' message is preceded by\line
'n' tab characters (not implemented on Microsoft compilers unless PNG_DEBUG_FILE\line
is also defined, to allow debug DLL compilation with no standard IO). message: a\line
printf(3) style text string. A trailing '\n' is added to the message. arg: 0 to\line
2 arguments for printf(3) style substitution in message. /\line

for MSER extraction 1. there are two different implementation of MSER, one for\line
grey image, one for color image 2. the grey image algorithm is taken from:\line
Linear Time Maximally Stable Extremal Regions; the paper claims to be faster\line
than union-find method; it actually get 1.5~2m/s on my centrino L7200 1.2GHz\line
laptop. 3. the color image algorithm is taken from: Maximally Stable Colour\line
Regions for Recognition and Match; it should be much slower than grey image\line
method ( 3~4 times ); the chi_table.h file is taken directly from paper's source\line
code which is distributed under GPL. 4. though the name is contours, the result\line
actually is a list of point set. /\line

            improvements, modifications or developments that\line
            Mentor Graphics conceived or made during or\line
            subsequent to this Agreement, including those based\line
            partly or wholly on Customer's feedback, will be the\line
            exclusive property of Mentor Graphics. Mentor\line
            Graphics will have exclusive rights, title and\line
            interest in all such property. The provisions of\line
            this Subsection 4.3 shall survive termination of\line
            this Agreement.\line
    5. Restrictions on Use.\line
         1. Customer may copy Software only as reasonably\line
            necessary to support the authorized use, including\line
            archival and backup purposes. Each copy must include\line
            all notices and legends embedded in Software and\line
            affixed to its medium and container as received from\line
            Mentor Graphics. All copies shall remain the\line
            property of Mentor Graphics or its licensors. Except\line
            where embedded in Executable Code form in Customer's\line
            Product, Customer shall maintain a record of the\line
            number and location of all copies of Software,\line
            including copies merged with other software and\line
            products, and shall make those records available to\line
            Mentor Graphics upon request. Customer shall not\line
            make Products available in any form to any person\line
            other than Customer's employees, authorized\line
            manufacturers or authorized contractors, excluding\line
            Mentor Graphics competitors, whose job performance\line
            requires access and who are under obligations of\line
            confidentiality. Customer shall take appropriate\line
            action to protect the confidentiality of Products\line
            and ensure that any person permitted access does not\line
            disclose or use Products except as permitted by this\line
            Agreement. Customer shall give Mentor Graphics\line
            immediate written notice of any unauthorized\line
            disclosure or use of the Products as soon as\line
            Customer learns or becomes aware of such\line
            unauthorized disclosure or use.\line
         2. Customer acknowledges that the Products provided\line
            hereunder may contain Source Code which is\line
            proprietary and its confidentiality is of the\line
            highest importance and value to Mentor Graphics.\line
            Customer acknowledges that Mentor Graphics may be\line
            seriously harmed if such Source Code is disclosed in\line
            violation of this Agreement. Except as otherwise\line
            permitted for purposes of interoperability as\line
            specified by applicable and mandatory local law,\line
            Customer shall not reverse-assemble,\line
            reverse-compile, reverse-engineer or in any way\line
            derive any Source Code from Products that are not\line
            provided in Source Code form. Except as embedded in\line
            Executable Code in Customer's Product and\line
            distributed in the ordinary course of business, in\line
            no event shall Customer provide Products to Mentor\line
            Graphics competitors. Log files, data files, rule\line
            files and script files generated by or for the\line
            Software (collectively "Files") constitute and/or\line
            include confidential information of Mentor Graphics.\line
            Customer may share Files with third parties,\line
            excluding Mentor Graphics competitors, provided that\line
            the confidentiality of such Files is protected by\line
            written agreement at least as well as Customer\line
            protects other information of a similar nature or\line
            importance, but in any case with at least reasonable\line
            care. Under no circumstances shall Customer use\line
            Products or allow their use for the purpose of\line
            developing, enhancing or marketing any product that\line
            is in any way competitive with Products, or disclose\line
            to any third party the results of, or information\line
            pertaining to, any benchmark.\line
         3. Customer may not assign this Agreement or the rights\line
            and duties under it, or relocate, sublicense or\line
            otherwise transfer the Products, whether by\line
            operation of law or otherwise ("Attempted\line
            Transfer"), without Mentor Graphics' prior written\line
            consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,\line
            and payment of Mentor Graphics' then-current\line
            applicable relocation and/or transfer fees. Any\line
            Attempted Transfer without Mentor Graphics' prior\line
            written consent shall be a material breach of this\line
            Agreement and may, at Mentor Graphics' option,\line
            result in the immediate termination of the Agreement\line
            and/or the licenses granted under this Agreement.\line
            The terms of this Agreement, including without\line
            limitation the licensing and assignment provisions,\line
            shall be binding upon Customer's permitted\line
            successors in interest and assigns.\line
         4. Notwithstanding any provision in an OSS license\line
            agreement applicable to a component of the Sourcery\line
            CodeBench Software that permits the redistribution\line
            of such component to a third party in Source Code or\line
            binary form, Customer may not use any Mentor\line
            Graphics trademark, whether registered or\line
            unregistered, in connection with such distribution,\line
            and may not recompile the Open Source Software\line
            components with the --with-pkgversion or\line
            --with-bugurl configuration options that embed\line
            Mentor Graphics' trademarks in the resulting binary.\line
         5. The provisions of this Section 5 shall survive the\line
            termination of this Agreement.\line
    6. Support Services.\line
         1. Except as described in Sections 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4\line
            below, and unless otherwise specified in any\line
            applicable Addenda to this Agreement, to the extent\line
            Customer purchases support services, Mentor Graphics\line
            will provide Customer updates and technical support\line
            for the number of Developers at the Development\line
            Location(s) for which support is purchased in\line
            accordance with Mentor Graphics' then-current\line
            End-User Software Support Terms located at .\line
         2. To the extent Customer purchases support services\line
            for Sourcery CodeBench Software, support will be\line
            provided solely in accordance with the provisions of\line
            this Section 6.2. Mentor Graphics shall provide\line
            updates and technical support to Customer as\line
            described herein only on the condition that Customer\line
            uses the Executable Code form of the Sourcery\line
            CodeBench Software for internal use only and/or\line
            distributes the Redistributable Components in\line
            Executable Code form only (except as provided in a\line
            separate redistribution agreement with Mentor\line
            Graphics or as required by the applicable Open\line
            Source license). Any other distribution by Customer\line
            of the Sourcery CodeBench Software (or any component\line
            thereof) in any form, including distribution\line
            permitted by the applicable Open Source license,\line
            shall automatically terminate any remaining support\line
            term. Subject to the foregoing and the payment of\line
            support fees, Mentor Graphics will provide Customer\line
            updates and technical support for the number of\line
            Developers at the Development Location(s) for which\line
            support is purchased in accordance with Mentor\line
            Graphics' then-current Sourcery CodeBench Software\line
            Support Terms located at .\line
         3. To the extent Customer purchases support services\line
            for Sourcery VSIPL++, Mentor Graphics will provide\line
            Customer updates and technical support for the\line
            number of Developers at the Development Location(s)\line
            for which support is purchased solely in accordance\line
            with Mentor Graphics' then-current Sourcery VSIPL++\line
            Support Terms located at. .\line
         4. To the extent Customer purchases support services\line
            for Mentor Embedded Linux, Mentor Graphics will\line
            provide Customer updates and technical support for\line
            the number of Developers at the Development\line
            Location(s) for which support is purchased solely in\line
            accordance with Mentor Graphics' then-current Mentor\line
            Embedded Linux Support Terms located at .\line
    7. Third Party and Open Source Software. Products may\line
       contain Open Source Software or code distributed under a\line
       proprietary third party license agreement. Please see\line
       applicable Products documentation, including but not\line
       limited to license notice files, header files or source\line
       code for further details. Please see and for additional\line
       rights and obligations governing your use and\line
       distribution of Open Source Software. Customer agrees\line
       that it shall not subject any Product provided by Mentor\line
       Graphics under this Agreement to any Open Source Software\line
       license that does not otherwise apply to such Product. In\line
       the event of conflict between the terms of this\line
       Agreement, any Addenda and an applicable OSS or\line
       proprietary third party agreement, the OSS or proprietary\line
       third party agreement will control solely with respect to\line
       the OSS or proprietary third party software component.\line
       The provisions of this Section 7 shall survive the\line
       termination of this Agreement.\line
    8. Limited Warranty.\line
         1. Mentor Graphics warrants that during the warranty\line
            period its standard, generally supported Products,\line
            when properly installed, will substantially conform\line
            to the functional specifications set forth in the\line
            applicable user manual and/or specification. Mentor\line
            Graphics does not warrant that Products will meet\line
            Customer's requirements or that operation of\line
            Products will be uninterrupted or error free. The\line
            warranty period is 90 days starting on the 15th day\line
            after delivery or upon installation, whichever first\line
            occurs. Customer must notify Mentor Graphics in\line
            writing of any nonconformity within the warranty\line
            period. For the avoidance of doubt, this warranty\line
            applies only to the initial shipment of Products\line
            under an Order and does not renew or reset, for\line
            example, with the delivery of (a) Software updates\line
            or (b) authorization codes. This warranty shall not\line
            be valid if Products have been subject to misuse,\line
            unauthorized modification or improper installation.\line
            MENTOR GRAPHICS' ENTIRE LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER'S\line
            EXCLUSIVE REMEDY SHALL BE, AT MENTOR GRAPHICS'\line
            OPTION, EITHER (A) REFUND OF THE PRICE PAID UPON\line
            RETURN OF THE PRODUCTS TO MENTOR GRAPHICS OR (B)\line
            MODIFICATION OR REPLACEMENT OF THE PRODUCTS THAT DO\line
            NOT MEET THIS LIMITED WARRANTY, PROVIDED CUSTOMER\line
            HAS OTHERWISE COMPLIED WITH THIS AGREEMENT. MENTOR\line
            GRAPHICS MAKES NO WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO: (A)\line
            SERVICES; OR (B) PRODUCTS PROVIDED AT NO CHARGE,\line
            WHICH ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED\line
            IN WRITING.\line
         2. THE WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 8 ARE\line
            EXCLUSIVE TO CUSTOMER AND DO NOT APPLY TO ANY\line
            END-USER. NEITHER MENTOR GRAPHICS NOR ITS LICENSORS\line
            MAKE ANY OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR\line
            STATUTORY, WITH RESPECT TO PRODUCTS OR OTHER\line
            MATERIAL PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. MENTOR\line
            GRAPHICS AND ITS LICENSORS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ALL\line
            IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A\line
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF\line
            INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.\line
    9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. EXCEPT WHERE THIS EXCLUSION OR\line
       RESTRICTION OF LIABILITY WOULD BE VOID OR INEFFECTIVE\line
       UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR EITHER PARTY'S\line
       BREACH OF ITS CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS, CUSTOMER'S\line
       BREACH OF LICENSING TERMS OR CUSTOMER'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER\line
       SECTION 10, IN NO EVENT SHALL: (A) EITHER PARTY OR ITS\line
       RESPECTIVE LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, SPECIAL,\line
       INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOST\line
       PROFITS OR SAVINGS) WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR\line
       ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY OR ITS\line
       LICENSORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\line
       DAMAGES; AND (B) EITHER PARTY OR ITS RESPECTIVE\line
       LICENSORS' LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, FOR\line
       THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, LIABILITY FOR ATTORNEYS' FEES OR\line
       COSTS, EXCEED THE GREATER OF THE FEES PAID OR OWING TO\line
       MENTOR GRAPHICS FOR THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE GIVING RISE TO\line
       THE CLAIM OR $500,000 (FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND U.S.\line
       DOLLARS). NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, IN THE CASE\line
       WHERE NO AMOUNT WAS PAID, MENTOR GRAPHICS AND ITS\line
       LICENSORS SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES\line
       WHATSOEVER. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 9 SHALL\line
       SURVIVE THE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.\line
   10. Hazardous Applications.\line
         1. Customer agrees that Mentor Graphics has no control\line
            over Customer's testing or the specific applications\line
            and use that Customer will make of Products. Mentor\line
            Graphics Products are not specifically designed for\line
            use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft\line
            navigation or communications systems, air traffic\line
            control, life support systems, medical devices or\line
            other applications in which the failure of Mentor\line
            Graphics Products could lead to death, personal\line
            injury, or severe physical or environmental damage\line
            ("Hazardous Applications").\line
         2. CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES IT IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR\line
            TESTING PRODUCTS USED IN HAZARDOUS APPLICATIONS AND\line
            SHALL BE SOLELY LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES RESULTING\line
            FROM SUCH USE. NEITHER MENTOR GRAPHICS NOR ITS\line
            LICENSORS SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES RESULTING\line
            FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF PRODUCTS IN\line
            ANY HAZARDOUS APPLICATIONS.\line
         3. CUSTOMER AGREES TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS\line
            MENTOR GRAPHICS AND ITS LICENSORS FROM ANY CLAIMS,\line
            LOSS, COST, DAMAGE, EXPENSE OR LIABILITY, INCLUDING\line
            REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES, ARISING OUT OF OR IN\line
            CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF PRODUCTS AS DESCRIBED IN\line
            SECTION 10.1.\line
         4. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 10 SHALL SURVIVE THE\line
            TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.\line
   11. Infringement.\line
         1. Mentor Graphics will defend or settle, at its option\line
            and expense, any action brought against Customer in\line
            the United States, Canada, Japan, or member state of\line
            the European Union which alleges that any standard,\line
            generally supported Product acquired by Customer\line
            hereunder infringes a patent or copyright or\line
            misappropriates a trade secret in such jurisdiction.\line
            Mentor Graphics will pay any costs and damages\line
            finally awarded against Customer that are\line
            attributable to the action. Customer understands and\line
            agrees that as conditions to Mentor Graphics'\line
            obligations under this section Customer must: (a)\line
            notify Mentor Graphics promptly in writing of the\line
            action; (b) provide Mentor Graphics all reasonable\line
            information and assistance to settle or defend the\line
            action; and (c) grant Mentor Graphics sole authority\line
            and control of the defense or settlement of the\line
            action.\line
         2. If a claim is made under Subsection 11.1 Mentor\line
            Graphics may, at its option and expense, and in\line
            addition to its obligations under Section 11.1,\line
            either (a) replace or modify the Product so that it\line
            becomes noninfringing; or (b) procure for Customer\line
            the right to continue using the Product. If Mentor\line
            Graphics determines that neither of those\line
            alternatives is financially practical or otherwise\line
            reasonably available, Mentor Graphics may require\line
            the return of the Product and refund to Customer any\line
            purchase price or license fee(s) paid.\line
         3. Mentor Graphics has no liability to Customer if the\line
            claim is based upon: (a) the combination of the\line
            Product with any product not furnished by Mentor\line
            Graphics, where the Product itself is not\line
            infringing; (b) the modification of the Product\line
            other than by Mentor Graphics or as directed by\line
            Mentor Graphics, where the unmodified Product would\line
            not infringe; (c) the use of the infringing Product\line
            when Mentor Graphics has provided Customer with a\line
            current unaltered release of a non-infringing\line
            Product of substantially similar functionality in\line
            accordance with Subsection 11.2(a); (d) the use of\line
            the Product as part of an infringing process; (e) a\line
            product that Customer makes, uses, or sells, where\line
            the Product itself is not infringing; (f) any\line
            Product provided at no charge; (g) any software\line
            provided by Mentor Graphics' licensors who do not\line
            provide such indemnification to Mentor Graphics'\line
            customers; (h) Open Source Software, except to the\line
            extent that the infringement is directly caused by\line
            Mentor Graphics' modifications to such Open Source\line
            Software; or (i) infringement by Customer that is\line
            deemed willful. In the case of (i), Customer shall\line
            reimburse Mentor Graphics for its reasonable\line
            attorneys' fees and other costs related to the\line
            action.\line
         4. THIS SECTION 11 IS SUBJECT TO SECTION 9 ABOVE AND\line
            STATES: (A) THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF MENTOR GRAPHICS\line
            AND ITS LICENSORS AND (B) CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND\line
            EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, WITH RESPECT TO ANY ALLEGED PATENT\line
            OR COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT OR TRADE SECRET\line
            MISAPPROPRIATION BY ANY PRODUCT PROVIDED UNDER THIS\line
            AGREEMENT.\line
   12. Termination and Effect of Termination. If a Software\line
       license was provided for limited term use, such license\line
       will automatically terminate at the end of the authorized\line
       Term.\line
         1. Termination for Breach. This Agreement shall remain\line
            in effect until terminated in accordance with its\line
            terms. Mentor Graphics may terminate this Agreement\line
            and/or any licenses granted under this Agreement,\line
            and Customer will immediately discontinue use and\line
            distribution of Products, if Customer (a) commits\line
            any material breach of any provision of this\line
            Agreement and fails to cure such breach upon 30-days\line
            prior written notice; or (b) becomes insolvent,\line
            files a bankruptcy petition, institutes proceedings\line
            for liquidation or winding up or enters into an\line
            agreement to assign its assets for the benefit of\line
            creditors. Termination of this Agreement or any\line
            license granted hereunder will not affect Customer's\line
            obligation to pay for Products shipped or licenses\line
            granted prior to the termination, which amounts\line
            shall be payable immediately upon the date of\line
            termination. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in\line
            this Section 12 shall be construed to prevent Mentor\line
            Graphics from seeking immediate injunctive relief in\line
            the event of any threatened or actual breach of\line
            Customer's obligations hereunder.\line
         2. Effect of Termination. Upon termination of this\line
            Agreement, the rights and obligations of the parties\line
            shall cease except as expressly set forth in this\line
            Agreement. Upon termination or expiration of the\line
            Term, Customer will discontinue use and/or\line
            distribution of Products, and shall return Hardware\line
            and either return to Mentor Graphics or destroy\line
            Software in Customer's possession, including all\line
            copies and documentation, and certify in writing to\line
            Mentor Graphics within ten business days of the\line
            termination date that Customer no longer possesses\line
            any of the affected Products or copies of Software\line
            in any form, except to the extent an Open Source\line
            Software license conflicts with this Section 12.2\line

            licensed according to the terms of this Agreement,\line
            if applicable to such End-User, and (b) such\line
            End-User is not in breach of its agreement, if\line

       products, information about the products, and direct or\line
       indirect products thereof, to certain countries and\line
       certain persons. Customer agrees that it will not export\line
       Products in any manner without first obtaining all\line
       necessary approval from appropriate local and United\line
       States government agencies. Customer acknowledges that\line
       the regulation of product export is in continuous\line
       modification by local governments and/or the United\line
       States Congress and administrative agencies. Customer\line
       agrees to complete all documents and to meet all\line
       requirements arising out of such modifications.\line
   14. U.S. Government License Rights. Software was developed\line

       and disclosure of the Software by or for the U.S.\line
       Government or a U.S. Government subcontractor is subject\line
       solely to the terms and conditions set forth in this\line
       Agreement, except for provisions which are contrary to\line
       applicable mandatory federal laws.\line
   15. Third Party Beneficiary. For any Products licensed under\line
       this Agreement and provided by Customer to End-Users,\line
       Mentor Graphics or the applicable licensor is a third\line
       party beneficiary of the agreement between Customer and\line
       End-User. Mentor Graphics Corporation, Mentor Graphics\line

       beneficiaries of this Agreement with the right to enforce\line
       the obligations set forth herein.\line
   16. Review of License Usage. Customer will monitor the access\line
       to and use of Software. With prior written notice, during\line
       Customer's normal business hours, and no more frequently\line
       than once per calendar year, Mentor Graphics may engage\line
       an internationally recognized accounting firm to review\line
       Customer's software monitoring system, records, accounts\line
       and sublicensing documents deemed relevant by the\line
       internationally recognized accounting firm to confirm\line
       Customer's compliance with the terms of this Agreement or\line
       U.S. or other local export laws. Such review may include\line
       FlexNet (or successor product) report log files that\line
       Customer shall capture and provide at Mentor Graphics'\line
       request. Customer shall make records available in\line
       electronic format and shall fully cooperate with data\line
       gathering to support the license review. Mentor Graphics\line
       shall bear the expense of any such review unless a\line
       material non-compliance is revealed. Mentor Graphics\line
       shall treat as confidential information all Customer\line
       information gained as a result of any request or review\line
       and shall only use or disclose such information as\line
       required by law or to enforce its rights under this\line
       Agreement. Such license review shall be at Mentor\line
       Graphics' expense unless it reveals a material\line
       underpayment of fees of five percent or more, in which\line
       case Customer shall reimburse Mentor Graphics for the\line
       costs of such license review. Customer shall promptly pay\line
       any such fees. If the license review reveals that\line
       Customer has made an overpayment, Mentor Graphics has the\line
       option to either provide the Customer with a refund or\line
       credit the amount overpaid to Customer's next payment.\line
       The provisions of this Section 16 shall survive the\line
       termination of this Agreement.\line
   17. Controlling Law, Jurisdiction and Dispute Resolution.\line
       This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under\line
       the laws of the State of California, USA, excluding\line
       choice of law rules. All disputes arising out of or in\line
       relation to this Agreement shall be submitted to the\line
       exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts of\line
       California, USA. Nothing in this section shall restrict\line
       Mentor Graphics' right to bring an action (including for\line
       example a motion for injunctive relief) against Customer\line
       or its Subsidiary in the jurisdiction where Customer's or\line
       its Subsidiary's place of business is located. The United\line
       Nations Convention on Contracts for the International\line
       Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.\line
   18. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held\line
       by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void, invalid,\line
       unenforceable or illegal, such provision shall be severed\line
       from this Agreement and the remaining provisions will\line
       remain in full force and effect.\line
   19. Miscellaneous. This Agreement contains the parties'\line
       entire understanding relating to its subject matter and\line
       supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements,\line
       including but not limited to any purchase order terms and\line
       conditions. This Agreement may only be modified in\line
       writing, signed by an authorized representative of each\line
       party. Waiver of terms or excuse of breach must be in\line
       writing and shall not constitute subsequent consent,\line
       waiver or excuse.\line

be unreasonably withheld, and payment of Mentor Graphics' then-current applicable relocation\line
and/or transfer fees. Any Attempted Transfer without Mentor Graphics' prior written\line
consent shall be a material breach of this Agreement and may, at Mentor Graphics' option,\line
result in the immediate termination of the Agreement and/or the licenses granted under\line
this Agreement. The terms of this Agreement, including without limitation the licensing\line
and assignment provisions, shall be binding upon Customer's permitted successors in interest\line
and assigns.\line
5.4. Notwithstanding any provision in an OSS license agreement applicable to a component of\line
the Sourcery CodeBench Software that permits the redistribution of such component to a\line
third party in Source Code or binary form, Customer may not use any Mentor Graphics\line
trademark, whether registered or unregistered, in connection with such distribution, and\line
may not recompile the Open Source Software components with the --with-pkgversion or\line

10.4. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 10 SHALL SURVIVE THE TERMINATION\line

11. Infringement.\line
11.1. Mentor Graphics will defend or settle, at its option and expense, any action brought against\line
Customer in the United States, Canada, Japan, or member state of the European Union\line
which alleges that any standard, generally supported Product acquired by Customer hereunder\line
infringes a patent or copyright or misappropriates a trade secret in such jurisdiction.\line
Mentor Graphics will pay any costs and damages finally awarded against Customer that\line
are attributable to the action. Customer understands and agrees that as conditions to\line
Mentor Graphics' obligations under this section Customer must: (a) notify Mentor Graphics\line
promptly in writing of the action; (b) provide Mentor Graphics all reasonable information\line
and assistance to settle or defend the action; and (c) grant Mentor Graphics sole authority\line
and control of the defense or settlement of the action.\line
11.2. If a claim is made under Subsection 11.1 Mentor Graphics may, at its option and expense,\line
and in addition to its obligations under Section 11.1, either (a) replace or modify the Product\line
so that it becomes noninfringing; or (b) procure for Customer the right to continue using\line
the Product. If Mentor Graphics determines that neither of those alternatives is financially\line
practical or otherwise reasonably available, Mentor Graphics may require the return of the\line
Product and refund to Customer any purchase price or license fee(s) paid.\line
11.3. Mentor Graphics has no liability to Customer if the claim is based upon: (a) the combination\line
of the Product with any product not furnished by Mentor Graphics, where the Product itself\line
is not infringing; (b) the modification of the Product other than by Mentor Graphics or as\line
directed by Mentor Graphics, where the unmodified Product would not infringe; (c) the\line
use of the infringing Product when Mentor Graphics has provided Customer with a current\line
unaltered release of a non-infringing Product of substantially similar functionality in accordance\line
with Subsection 11.2(a); (d) the use of the Product as part of an infringing process;\line
(e) a product that Customer makes, uses, or sells, where the Product itself is not infringing;\line
(f) any Product provided at no charge; (g) any software provided by Mentor Graphics' licensors\line
who do not provide such indemnification to Mentor Graphics' customers; (h) Open\line
Source Software, except to the extent that the infringement is directly caused by Mentor\line
Graphics' modifications to such Open Source Software; or (i) infringement by Customer\line
that is deemed willful. In the case of (i), Customer shall reimburse Mentor Graphics for\line
its reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs related to the action.\line
11.4. THIS SECTION 11 IS SUBJECT TO SECTION 9 ABOVE AND STATES: (A) THE\line
ENTIRE LIABILITY OF MENTOR GRAPHICS AND ITS LICENSORS AND (B)\line
CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, WITH RESPECT TO ANY ALLEGED\line
PATENT OR COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT OR TRADE SECRET MISAPPROPRIATION\line

Sourcery CodeBench Lite Licenses\line
12. Termination and Effect of Termination. If a Software license was provided for limited term\line
use, such license will automatically terminate at the end of the authorized Term.\line
12.1. Termination for Breach. This Agreement shall remain in effect until terminated in accordance\line
with its terms. Mentor Graphics may terminate this Agreement and/or any licenses\line
granted under this Agreement, and Customer will immediately discontinue use and distribution\line
of Products, if Customer (a) commits any material breach of any provision of this\line
Agreement and fails to cure such breach upon 30-days prior written notice; or (b) becomes\line
insolvent, files a bankruptcy petition, institutes proceedings for liquidation or winding up\line
or enters into an agreement to assign its assets for the benefit of creditors. Termination of\line
this Agreement or any license granted hereunder will not affect Customer's obligation to\line
pay for Products shipped or licenses granted prior to the termination, which amounts shall\line
be payable immediately upon the date of termination. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing\line
in this Section 12 shall be construed to prevent Mentor Graphics from seeking immediate\line
injunctive relief in the event of any threatened or actual breach of Customer's obligations\line
hereunder.\line
12.2. Effect of Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement, the rights and obligations\line
of the parties shall cease except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Upon termination\line
or expiration of the Term, Customer will discontinue use and/or distribution of Products,\line
and shall return Hardware and either return to Mentor Graphics or destroy Software in\line
Customer's possession, including all copies and documentation, and certify in writing to\line
Mentor Graphics within ten business days of the termination date that Customer no longer\line
possesses any of the affected Products or copies of Software in any form, except to the\line
extent an Open Source Software license conflicts with this Section 12.2 and permits Customer's\line
continued use of any Open Source Software portion or component of a Product.\line
Upon termination for Customer's breach, an End-User may continue its use and/or distribution\line
of Customer's Product so long as: (a) the End-User was licensed according to the\line
terms of this Agreement, if applicable to such End-User, and (b) such End-User is not in\line
breach of its agreement, if applicable, nor a party to Customer's breach.\line
13. Export. The Products provided hereunder are subject to regulation by local laws and United\line
States government agencies, which prohibit export or diversion of certain products, information\line
about the products, and direct or indirect products thereof, to certain countries and certain persons.\line
Customer agrees that it will not export Products in any manner without first obtaining all necessary\line
approval from appropriate local and United States government agencies. Customer acknowledges\line
that the regulation of product export is in continuous modification by local governments\line
and/or the United States Congress and administrative agencies. Customer agrees to complete\line
all documents and to meet all requirements arising out of such modifications.\line
14. U.S. Government License Rights. Software was developed entirely at private expense. All\line
Software is commercial computer software within the meaning of the applicable acquisition\line
regulations. Accordingly, pursuant to US FAR 48 CFR 12.212 and DFAR 48 CFR 227.7202,\line
use, duplication and disclosure of the Software by or for the U.S. Government or a U.S. Government\line
subcontractor is subject solely to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,\line
except for provisions which are contrary to applicable mandatory federal laws.\line
15. Third Party Beneficiary. For any Products licensed under this Agreement and provided by\line
Customer to End-Users, Mentor Graphics or the applicable licensor is a third party beneficiary\line
of the agreement between Customer and End-User. Mentor Graphics Corporation, Mentor\line
Graphics (Ireland) Limited, and other licensors may be third party beneficiaries of this Agreement\line
with the right to enforce the obligations set forth herein.\line
16. Review of License Usage. Customer will monitor the access to and use of Software. With\line
prior written notice, during Customer's normal business hours, and no more frequently than\line
57\line
Sourcery CodeBench Lite Licenses\line
once per calendar year, Mentor Graphics may engage an internationally recognized accounting\line
firm to review Customer's software monitoring system, records, accounts and sublicensing\line
documents deemed relevant by the internationally recognized accounting firm to confirm Customer's\line
compliance with the terms of this Agreement or U.S. or other local export laws. Such\line
review may include FlexNet (or successor product) report log files that Customer shall capture\line
and provide at Mentor Graphics' request. Customer shall make records available in electronic\line
format and shall fully cooperate with data gathering to support the license review. Mentor\line
Graphics shall bear the expense of any such review unless a material non-compliance is revealed.\line
Mentor Graphics shall treat as confidential information all Customer information gained as a\line
result of any request or review and shall only use or disclose such information as required by\line
law or to enforce its rights under this Agreement. Such license review shall be at Mentor\line
Graphics' expense unless it reveals a material underpayment of fees of five percent or more, in\line
which case Customer shall reimburse Mentor Graphics for the costs of such license review.\line
Customer shall promptly pay any such fees. If the license review reveals that Customer has\line
made an overpayment, Mentor Graphics has the option to either provide the Customer with a\line
refund or credit the amount overpaid to Customer's next payment. The provisions of this Section\line
16 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.\line
17. Controlling Law, Jurisdiction and Dispute Resolution. This Agreement shall be governed\line
by and construed under the laws of the State of California, USA, excluding choice of law rules.\line
All disputes arising out of or in relation to this Agreement shall be submitted to the exclusive\line
jurisdiction of the state and federal courts of California, USA. Nothing in this section shall restrict\line
Mentor Graphics' right to bring an action (including for example a motion for injunctive relief)\line
against Customer or its Subsidiary in the jurisdiction where Customer's or its Subsidiary's place\line
of business is located. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale\line
of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.\line
18. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction\line
to be void, invalid, unenforceable or illegal, such provision shall be severed from this Agreement\line
and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.\line
19. Miscellaneous. This Agreement contains the parties' entire understanding relating to its subject\line
matter and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, including but not limited to\line
any purchase order terms and conditions. This Agreement may only be modified in writing,\line
signed by an authorized representative of each party. Waiver of terms or excuse of breach must\line
be in writing and shall not constitute subsequent consent, waiver or excuse.\line

                 only as part of Customer's Object Code\line
                 developed with the Software that provides\line
                 substantially different functionality than the\line
                 Redistributable Component(s) alone.\line
              6. Sourcery CodeBench Personal Edition License:\line
                 During the Term specified in the applicable\line
                 Addenda, Customer may (a) install and use the\line
                 Proprietary Components of the Software by a\line
                 single user who uses the Software on one\line
                 machine, and (b) distribute the Redistributable\line
                 Component(s) of the Software in Executable Code\line
                 form only and only as part of Customer Object\line
                 Code developed with the Software that provides\line
                 substantially different functionality than the\line
                 Redistributable Component(s) alone.\line
              7. Sourcery CodeBench Academic Edition License:\line
                 During the Term specified in the applicable\line
                 Addenda, Customer may (a) install and use the\line
                 Proprietary Components of the Software for\line
                 non-commercial, academic purposes only by a\line
                 single user who uses the Software on one\line
                 machine, and (b) distribute the Redistributable\line
                 Component(s) of the Software in Executable Code\line
                 form only and only as part of Customer Object\line
                 Code developed with the Software that provides\line
                 substantially different functionality than the\line
                 Redistributable Component(s) alone.\line
         3. Mentor Graphics may from time to time, in its sole\line
            discretion, lend Products to Customer. For each\line
            loan, Mentor Graphics will identify in writing the\line
            quantity and description of Software loaned, the\line
            authorized location and the Term of the loan. Mentor\line
            Graphics will grant to Customer a temporary license\line
            to use the loaned Software solely for Customer's\line
            internal evaluation in a non-production environment.\line
            Customer shall return to Mentor Graphics or delete\line
            and destroy loaned Software on or before the\line
            expiration of the loan Term. Customer will sign a\line
            certification of such deletion or destruction if\line
            requested by Mentor Graphics.\line
    4. Beta Code.\line
         1. Portions or all of certain Products may contain code\line
            for experimental testing and evaluation ("Beta\line
            Code"), which may not be used without Mentor\line
            Graphics' explicit authorization. Upon Mentor\line
            Graphics' authorization, Mentor Graphics grants to\line
            Customer a temporary, nontransferable, nonexclusive\line
            license for experimental use to test and evaluate\line
            the Beta Code without charge for a limited period of\line
            time specified by Mentor Graphics. This grant and\line
            Customer's use of the Beta Code shall not be\line
            construed as marketing or offering to sell a license\line
            to the Beta Code, which Mentor Graphics may choose\line
            not to release commercially in any form.\line
         2. If Mentor Graphics authorizes Customer to use the\line
            Beta Code, Customer agrees to evaluate and test the\line
            Beta Code under normal conditions as directed by\line
            Mentor Graphics. Customer will contact Mentor\line
            Graphics periodically during Customer's use of the\line
            Beta Code to discuss any malfunctions or suggested\line
            improvements. Upon completion of Customer's\line
            evaluation and testing, Customer will send to Mentor\line
            Graphics a written evaluation of the Beta Code,\line
            including its strengths, weaknesses and recommended\line
            improvements.\line
         3. Customer agrees to maintain Beta Code in confidence\line
            and shall restrict access to the Beta Code,\line
            including the methods and concepts utilized therein,\line
            solely to those employees and Customer location(s)\line
            authorized by Mentor Graphics to perform beta\line
            testing. Customer agrees that any written\line
            evaluations and all inventions, product\line
            improvements, modifications or developments that\line
            Mentor Graphics conceived or made during or\line
            subsequent to this Agreement, including those based\line
            partly or wholly on Customer's feedback, will be the\line
            exclusive property of Mentor Graphics. Mentor\line
            Graphics will have exclusive rights, title and\line
            interest in all such property. The provisions of\line
            this Subsection 4.3 shall survive termination of\line
            this Agreement.\line
    5. Restrictions on Use.\line
         1. Customer may copy Software only as reasonably\line
            necessary to support the authorized use, including\line
            archival and backup purposes. Each copy must include\line
            all notices and legends embedded in Software and\line
            affixed to its medium and container as received from\line
            Mentor Graphics. All copies shall remain the\line
            property of Mentor Graphics or its licensors. Except\line
            where embedded in Executable Code form in Customer's\line
            Product, Customer shall maintain a record of the\line
            number and location of all copies of Software,\line
            including copies merged with other software and\line
            products, and shall make those records available to\line
            Mentor Graphics upon request. Customer shall not\line
            make Products available in any form to any person\line
            other than Customer's employees, authorized\line
            manufacturers or authorized contractors, excluding\line
            Mentor Graphics competitors, whose job performance\line
            requires access and who are under obligations of\line
            confidentiality. Customer shall take appropriate\line
            action to protect the confidentiality of Products\line
            and ensure that any person permitted access does not\line
            disclose or use Products except as permitted by this\line
            Agreement. Customer shall give Mentor Graphics\line
            immediate written notice of any unauthorized\line
            disclosure or use of the Products as soon as\line
            Customer learns or becomes aware of such\line
            unauthorized disclosure or use.\line
         2. Customer acknowledges that the Products provided\line
            hereunder may contain Source Code which is\line
            proprietary and its confidentiality is of the\line
            highest importance and value to Mentor Graphics.\line
            Customer acknowledges that Mentor Graphics may be\line
            seriously harmed if such Source Code is disclosed in\line
            violation of this Agreement. Except as otherwise\line
            permitted for purposes of interoperability as\line
            specified by applicable and mandatory local law,\line
            Customer shall not reverse-assemble,\line
            reverse-compile, reverse-engineer or in any way\line
            derive any Source Code from Products that are not\line
            provided in Source Code form. Except as embedded in\line
            Executable Code in Customer's Product and\line
            distributed in the ordinary course of business, in\line
            no event shall Customer provide Products to Mentor\line
            Graphics competitors. Log files, data files, rule\line
            files and script files generated by or for the\line
            Software (collectively "Files") constitute and/or\line
            include confidential information of Mentor Graphics.\line
            Customer may share Files with third parties,\line
            excluding Mentor Graphics competitors, provided that\line
            the confidentiality of such Files is protected by\line
            written agreement at least as well as Customer\line
            protects other information of a similar nature or\line
            importance, but in any case with at least reasonable\line
            care. Under no circumstances shall Customer use\line
            Products or allow their use for the purpose of\line
            developing, enhancing or marketing any product that\line
            is in any way competitive with Products, or disclose\line
            to any third party the results of, or information\line
            pertaining to, any benchmark.\line
         3. Customer may not assign this Agreement or the rights\line
            and duties under it, or relocate, sublicense or\line
            otherwise transfer the Products, whether by\line
            operation of law or otherwise ("Attempted\line
            Transfer"), without Mentor Graphics' prior written\line
            consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,\line
            and payment of Mentor Graphics' then-current\line
            applicable relocation and/or transfer fees. Any\line
            Attempted Transfer without Mentor Graphics' prior\line
            written consent shall be a material breach of this\line
            Agreement and may, at Mentor Graphics' option,\line
            result in the immediate termination of the Agreement\line
            and/or the licenses granted under this Agreement.\line
            The terms of this Agreement, including without\line
            limitation the licensing and assignment provisions,\line
            shall be binding upon Customer's permitted\line
            successors in interest and assigns.\line
         4. Notwithstanding any provision in an OSS license\line
            agreement applicable to a component of the Sourcery\line
            CodeBench Software that permits the redistribution\line
            of such component to a third party in Source Code or\line
            binary form, Customer may not use any Mentor\line
            Graphics trademark, whether registered or\line
            unregistered, in connection with such distribution,\line
            and may not recompile the Open Source Software\line
            components with the --with-pkgversion or\line
            --with-bugurl configuration options that embed\line
            Mentor Graphics' trademarks in the resulting binary.\line
         5. The provisions of this Section 5 shall survive the\line
            termination of this Agreement.\line
    6. Support Services.\line
         1. Except as described in Sections 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4\line
            below, and unless otherwise specified in any\line
            applicable Addenda to this Agreement, to the extent\line
            Customer purchases support services, Mentor Graphics\line
            will provide Customer updates and technical support\line
            for the number of Developers at the Development\line
            Location(s) for which support is purchased in\line
            accordance with Mentor Graphics' then-current\line
            End-User Software Support Terms located at .\line
         2. To the extent Customer purchases support services\line
            for Sourcery CodeBench Software, support will be\line
            provided solely in accordance with the provisions of\line
            this Section 6.2. Mentor Graphics shall provide\line
            updates and technical support to Customer as\line
            described herein only on the condition that Customer\line
            uses the Executable Code form of the Sourcery\line
            CodeBench Software for internal use only and/or\line
            distributes the Redistributable Components in\line
            Executable Code form only (except as provided in a\line
            separate redistribution agreement with Mentor\line
            Graphics or as required by the applicable Open\line
            Source license). Any other distribution by Customer\line
            of the Sourcery CodeBench Software (or any component\line
            thereof) in any form, including distribution\line
            permitted by the applicable Open Source license,\line
            shall automatically terminate any remaining support\line
            term. Subject to the foregoing and the payment of\line
            support fees, Mentor Graphics will provide Customer\line
            updates and technical support for the number of\line
            Developers at the Development Location(s) for which\line
            support is purchased in accordance with Mentor\line
            Graphics' then-current Sourcery CodeBench Software\line
            Support Terms located at .\line
         3. To the extent Customer purchases support services\line
            for Sourcery VSIPL++, Mentor Graphics will provide\line
            Customer updates and technical support for the\line
            number of Developers at the Development Location(s)\line
            for which support is purchased solely in accordance\line
            with Mentor Graphics' then-current Sourcery VSIPL++\line
            Support Terms located at. .\line
         4. To the extent Customer purchases support services\line
            for Mentor Embedded Linux, Mentor Graphics will\line
            provide Customer updates and technical support for\line
            the number of Developers at the Development\line
            Location(s) for which support is purchased solely in\line
            accordance with Mentor Graphics' then-current Mentor\line
            Embedded Linux Support Terms located at .\line
    7. Third Party and Open Source Software. Products may\line
       contain Open Source Software or code distributed under a\line
       proprietary third party license agreement. Please see\line
       applicable Products documentation, including but not\line
       limited to license notice files, header files or source\line
       code for further details. Please see and for additional\line
       rights and obligations governing your use and\line
       distribution of Open Source Software. Customer agrees\line
       that it shall not subject any Product provided by Mentor\line
       Graphics under this Agreement to any Open Source Software\line
       license that does not otherwise apply to such Product. In\line
       the event of conflict between the terms of this\line
       Agreement, any Addenda and an applicable OSS or\line
       proprietary third party agreement, the OSS or proprietary\line
       third party agreement will control solely with respect to\line
       the OSS or proprietary third party software component.\line
       The provisions of this Section 7 shall survive the\line
       termination of this Agreement.\line
    8. Limited Warranty.\line
         1. Mentor Graphics warrants that during the warranty\line
            period its standard, generally supported Products,\line
            when properly installed, will substantially conform\line
            to the functional specifications set forth in the\line
            applicable user manual and/or specification. Mentor\line
            Graphics does not warrant that Products will meet\line
            Customer's requirements or that operation of\line
            Products will be uninterrupted or error free. The\line
            warranty period is 90 days starting on the 15th day\line
            after delivery or upon installation, whichever first\line
            occurs. Customer must notify Mentor Graphics in\line
            writing of any nonconformity within the warranty\line
            period. For the avoidance of doubt, this warranty\line
            applies only to the initial shipment of Products\line
            under an Order and does not renew or reset, for\line
            example, with the delivery of (a) Software updates\line
            or (b) authorization codes. This warranty shall not\line
            be valid if Products have been subject to misuse,\line
            unauthorized modification or improper installation.\line
            MENTOR GRAPHICS' ENTIRE LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER'S\line
            EXCLUSIVE REMEDY SHALL BE, AT MENTOR GRAPHICS'\line
            OPTION, EITHER (A) REFUND OF THE PRICE PAID UPON\line
            RETURN OF THE PRODUCTS TO MENTOR GRAPHICS OR (B)\line
            MODIFICATION OR REPLACEMENT OF THE PRODUCTS THAT DO\line
            NOT MEET THIS LIMITED WARRANTY, PROVIDED CUSTOMER\line
            HAS OTHERWISE COMPLIED WITH THIS AGREEMENT. MENTOR\line
            GRAPHICS MAKES NO WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO: (A)\line
            SERVICES; OR (B) PRODUCTS PROVIDED AT NO CHARGE,\line
            WHICH ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED\line
            IN WRITING.\line
         2. THE WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 8 ARE\line
            EXCLUSIVE TO CUSTOMER AND DO NOT APPLY TO ANY\line
            END-USER. NEITHER MENTOR GRAPHICS NOR ITS LICENSORS\line
            MAKE ANY OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR\line
            STATUTORY, WITH RESPECT TO PRODUCTS OR OTHER\line
            MATERIAL PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. MENTOR\line
            GRAPHICS AND ITS LICENSORS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ALL\line
            IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A\line
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF\line
            INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.\line
    9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. EXCEPT WHERE THIS EXCLUSION OR\line
       RESTRICTION OF LIABILITY WOULD BE VOID OR INEFFECTIVE\line
       UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR EITHER PARTY'S\line
       BREACH OF ITS CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS, CUSTOMER'S\line
       BREACH OF LICENSING TERMS OR CUSTOMER'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER\line
       SECTION 10, IN NO EVENT SHALL: (A) EITHER PARTY OR ITS\line
       RESPECTIVE LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, SPECIAL,\line
       INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOST\line
       PROFITS OR SAVINGS) WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR\line
       ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY OR ITS\line
       LICENSORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\line
       DAMAGES; AND (B) EITHER PARTY OR ITS RESPECTIVE\line
       LICENSORS' LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, FOR\line
       THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, LIABILITY FOR ATTORNEYS' FEES OR\line
       COSTS, EXCEED THE GREATER OF THE FEES PAID OR OWING TO\line
       MENTOR GRAPHICS FOR THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE GIVING RISE TO\line
       THE CLAIM OR $500,000 (FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND U.S.\line
       DOLLARS). NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, IN THE CASE\line
       WHERE NO AMOUNT WAS PAID, MENTOR GRAPHICS AND ITS\line
       LICENSORS SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES\line
       WHATSOEVER. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 9 SHALL\line
       SURVIVE THE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.\line
   10. Hazardous Applications.\line
         1. Customer agrees that Mentor Graphics has no control\line
            over Customer's testing or the specific applications\line
            and use that Customer will make of Products. Mentor\line
            Graphics Products are not specifically designed for\line
            use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft\line
            navigation or communications systems, air traffic\line
            control, life support systems, medical devices or\line
            other applications in which the failure of Mentor\line
            Graphics Products could lead to death, personal\line
            injury, or severe physical or environmental damage\line
            ("Hazardous Applications").\line
         2. CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES IT IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR\line
            TESTING PRODUCTS USED IN HAZARDOUS APPLICATIONS AND\line
            SHALL BE SOLELY LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES RESULTING\line
            FROM SUCH USE. NEITHER MENTOR GRAPHICS NOR ITS\line
            LICENSORS SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES RESULTING\line
            FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF PRODUCTS IN\line
            ANY HAZARDOUS APPLICATIONS.\line
         3. CUSTOMER AGREES TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS\line
            MENTOR GRAPHICS AND ITS LICENSORS FROM ANY CLAIMS,\line
            LOSS, COST, DAMAGE, EXPENSE OR LIABILITY, INCLUDING\line
            REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES, ARISING OUT OF OR IN\line
            CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF PRODUCTS AS DESCRIBED IN\line
            SECTION 10.1.\line
         4. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 10 SHALL SURVIVE THE\line
            TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.\line
   11. Infringement.\line
         1. Mentor Graphics will defend or settle, at its option\line
            and expense, any action brought against Customer in\line
            the United States, Canada, Japan, or member state of\line
            the European Union which alleges that any standard,\line
            generally supported Product acquired by Customer\line
            hereunder infringes a patent or copyright or\line
            misappropriates a trade secret in such jurisdiction.\line
            Mentor Graphics will pay any costs and damages\line
            finally awarded against Customer that are\line
            attributable to the action. Customer understands and\line
            agrees that as conditions to Mentor Graphics'\line
            obligations under this section Customer must: (a)\line
            notify Mentor Graphics promptly in writing of the\line
            action; (b) provide Mentor Graphics all reasonable\line
            information and assistance to settle or defend the\line
            action; and (c) grant Mentor Graphics sole authority\line
            and control of the defense or settlement of the\line
            action.\line
         2. If a claim is made under Subsection 11.1 Mentor\line
            Graphics may, at its option and expense, and in\line
            addition to its obligations under Section 11.1,\line
            either (a) replace or modify the Product so that it\line
            becomes noninfringing; or (b) procure for Customer\line
            the right to continue using the Product. If Mentor\line
            Graphics determines that neither of those\line
            alternatives is financially practical or otherwise\line
            reasonably available, Mentor Graphics may require\line
            the return of the Product and refund to Customer any\line
            purchase price or license fee(s) paid.\line
         3. Mentor Graphics has no liability to Customer if the\line
            claim is based upon: (a) the combination of the\line
            Product with any product not furnished by Mentor\line
            Graphics, where the Product itself is not\line
            infringing; (b) the modification of the Product\line
            other than by Mentor Graphics or as directed by\line
            Mentor Graphics, where the unmodified Product would\line
            not infringe; (c) the use of the infringing Product\line
            when Mentor Graphics has provided Customer with a\line
            current unaltered release of a non-infringing\line
            Product of substantially similar functionality in\line
            accordance with Subsection 11.2(a); (d) the use of\line
            the Product as part of an infringing process; (e) a\line
            product that Customer makes, uses, or sells, where\line
            the Product itself is not infringing; (f) any\line
            Product provided at no charge; (g) any software\line
            provided by Mentor Graphics' licensors who do not\line
            provide such indemnification to Mentor Graphics'\line
            customers; (h) Open Source Software, except to the\line
            extent that the infringement is directly caused by\line
            Mentor Graphics' modifications to such Open Source\line
            Software; or (i) infringement by Customer that is\line
            deemed willful. In the case of (i), Customer shall\line
            reimburse Mentor Graphics for its reasonable\line
            attorneys' fees and other costs related to the\line
            action.\line
         4. THIS SECTION 11 IS SUBJECT TO SECTION 9 ABOVE AND\line
            STATES: (A) THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF MENTOR GRAPHICS\line
            AND ITS LICENSORS AND (B) CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND\line
            EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, WITH RESPECT TO ANY ALLEGED PATENT\line
            OR COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT OR TRADE SECRET\line
            MISAPPROPRIATION BY ANY PRODUCT PROVIDED UNDER THIS\line
            AGREEMENT.\line
   12. Termination and Effect of Termination. If a Software\line
       license was provided for limited term use, such license\line
       will automatically terminate at the end of the authorized\line
       Term.\line
         1. Termination for Breach. This Agreement shall remain\line
            in effect until terminated in accordance with its\line
            terms. Mentor Graphics may terminate this Agreement\line
            and/or any licenses granted under this Agreement,\line
            and Customer will immediately discontinue use and\line
            distribution of Products, if Customer (a) commits\line
            any material breach of any provision of this\line
            Agreement and fails to cure such breach upon 30-days\line
            prior written notice; or (b) becomes insolvent,\line
            files a bankruptcy petition, institutes proceedings\line
            for liquidation or winding up or enters into an\line
            agreement to assign its assets for the benefit of\line
            creditors. Termination of this Agreement or any\line
            license granted hereunder will not affect Customer's\line
            obligation to pay for Products shipped or licenses\line
            granted prior to the termination, which amounts\line
            shall be payable immediately upon the date of\line
            termination. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in\line
            this Section 12 shall be construed to prevent Mentor\line
            Graphics from seeking immediate injunctive relief in\line
            the event of any threatened or actual breach of\line
            Customer's obligations hereunder.\line
         2. Effect of Termination. Upon termination of this\line
            Agreement, the rights and obligations of the parties\line
            shall cease except as expressly set forth in this\line
            Agreement. Upon termination or expiration of the\line
            Term, Customer will discontinue use and/or\line
            distribution of Products, and shall return Hardware\line
            and either return to Mentor Graphics or destroy\line
            Software in Customer's possession, including all\line
            copies and documentation, and certify in writing to\line
            Mentor Graphics within ten business days of the\line
            termination date that Customer no longer possesses\line
            any of the affected Products or copies of Software\line
            in any form, except to the extent an Open Source\line
            Software license conflicts with this Section 12.2\line
            and permits Customer's continued use of any Open\line
            Source Software portion or component of a Product.\line
            Upon termination for Customer's breach, an End-User\line
            may continue its use and/or distribution of\line
            Customer's Product so long as: (a) the End-User was\line
            licensed according to the terms of this Agreement,\line
            if applicable to such End-User, and (b) such\line
            End-User is not in breach of its agreement, if\line
            applicable, nor a party to Customer's breach.\line
   13. Export. The Products provided hereunder are subject to\line
       regulation by local laws and United States government\line
       agencies, which prohibit export or diversion of certain\line
       products, information about the products, and direct or\line
       indirect products thereof, to certain countries and\line
       certain persons. Customer agrees that it will not export\line
       Products in any manner without first obtaining all\line
       necessary approval from appropriate local and United\line
       States government agencies. Customer acknowledges that\line
       the regulation of product export is in continuous\line
       modification by local governments and/or the United\line
       States Congress and administrative agencies. Customer\line
       agrees to complete all documents and to meet all\line
       requirements arising out of such modifications.\line
   14. U.S. Government License Rights. Software was developed\line
       entirely at private expense. All Software is commercial\line
       computer software within the meaning of the applicable\line
       acquisition regulations. Accordingly, pursuant to US FAR\line
       48 CFR 12.212 and DFAR 48 CFR 227.7202, use, duplication\line
       and disclosure of the Software by or for the U.S.\line
       Government or a U.S. Government subcontractor is subject\line
       solely to the terms and conditions set forth in this\line
       Agreement, except for provisions which are contrary to\line
       applicable mandatory federal laws.\line
   15. Third Party Beneficiary. For any Products licensed under\line
       this Agreement and provided by Customer to End-Users,\line
       Mentor Graphics or the applicable licensor is a third\line
       party beneficiary of the agreement between Customer and\line
       End-User. Mentor Graphics Corporation, Mentor Graphics\line
       (Ireland) Limited, and other licensors may be third party\line
       beneficiaries of this Agreement with the right to enforce\line
       the obligations set forth herein.\line
   16. Review of License Usage. Customer will monitor the access\line
       to and use of Software. With prior written notice, during\line
       Customer's normal business hours, and no more frequently\line
       than once per calendar year, Mentor Graphics may engage\line
       an internationally recognized accounting firm to review\line
       Customer's software monitoring system, records, accounts\line
       and sublicensing documents deemed relevant by the\line
       internationally recognized accounting firm to confirm\line
       Customer's compliance with the terms of this Agreement or\line
       U.S. or other local export laws. Such review may include\line
       FlexNet (or successor product) report log files that\line
       Customer shall capture and provide at Mentor Graphics'\line
       request. Customer shall make records available in\line
       electronic format and shall fully cooperate with data\line
       gathering to support the license review. Mentor Graphics\line
       shall bear the expense of any such review unless a\line
       material non-compliance is revealed. Mentor Graphics\line
       shall treat as confidential information all Customer\line
       information gained as a result of any request or review\line
       and shall only use or disclose such information as\line
       required by law or to enforce its rights under this\line
       Agreement. Such license review shall be at Mentor\line
       Graphics' expense unless it reveals a material\line
       underpayment of fees of five percent or more, in which\line
       case Customer shall reimburse Mentor Graphics for the\line
       costs of such license review. Customer shall promptly pay\line
       any such fees. If the license review reveals that\line
       Customer has made an overpayment, Mentor Graphics has the\line
       option to either provide the Customer with a refund or\line
       credit the amount overpaid to Customer's next payment.\line
       The provisions of this Section 16 shall survive the\line
       termination of this Agreement.\line
   17. Controlling Law, Jurisdiction and Dispute Resolution.\line
       This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under\line
       the laws of the State of California, USA, excluding\line
       choice of law rules. All disputes arising out of or in\line
       relation to this Agreement shall be submitted to the\line
       exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts of\line
       California, USA. Nothing in this section shall restrict\line
       Mentor Graphics' right to bring an action (including for\line
       example a motion for injunctive relief) against Customer\line
       or its Subsidiary in the jurisdiction where Customer's or\line
       its Subsidiary's place of business is located. The United\line
       Nations Convention on Contracts for the International\line
       Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.\line
   18. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held\line
       by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void, invalid,\line
       unenforceable or illegal, such provision shall be severed\line
       from this Agreement and the remaining provisions will\line
       remain in full force and effect.\line
   19. Miscellaneous. This Agreement contains the parties'\line
       entire understanding relating to its subject matter and\line
       supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements,\line
       including but not limited to any purchase order terms and\line
       conditions. This Agreement may only be modified in\line
       writing, signed by an authorized representative of each\line
       party. Waiver of terms or excuse of breach must be in\line
       writing and shall not constitute subsequent consent,\line
       waiver or excuse.\line

Customer location(s) authorized by Mentor Graphics to perform beta testing. Customer\line
agrees that any written evaluations and all inventions, product improvements, modifications\line
or developments that Mentor Graphics conceived or made during or subsequent to this\line
Agreement, including those based partly or wholly on Customer's feedback, will be the\line
exclusive property of Mentor Graphics. Mentor Graphics will have exclusive rights, title\line
and interest in all such property. The provisions of this Subsection 4.3 shall survive termination\line
of this Agreement.\line
5. Restrictions on Use.\line
5.1. Customer may copy Software only as reasonably necessary to support the authorized use,\line
including archival and backup purposes. Each copy must include all notices and legends\line
44\line
Sourcery CodeBench Lite Licenses\line
embedded in Software and affixed to its medium and container as received from Mentor\line
Graphics. All copies shall remain the property of Mentor Graphics or its licensors. Except\line
where embedded in Executable Code form in Customer's Product, Customer shall maintain\line
a record of the number and location of all copies of Software, including copies merged\line
with other software and products, and shall make those records available to Mentor\line
Graphics upon request. Customer shall not make Products available in any form to any\line
person other than Customer's employees, authorized manufacturers or authorized contractors,\line
excluding Mentor Graphics competitors, whose job performance requires access and who\line
are under obligations of confidentiality. Customer shall take appropriate action to protect\line
the confidentiality of Products and ensure that any person permitted access does not disclose\line
or use Products except as permitted by this Agreement. Customer shall give Mentor\line
Graphics immediate written notice of any unauthorized disclosure or use of the Products\line
as soon as Customer learns or becomes aware of such unauthorized disclosure or use.\line
5.2. Customer acknowledges that the Products provided hereunder may contain Source Code\line
which is proprietary and its confidentiality is of the highest importance and value to\line
Mentor Graphics. Customer acknowledges that Mentor Graphics may be seriously harmed\line
if such Source Code is disclosed in violation of this Agreement. Except as otherwise permitted\line
for purposes of interoperability as specified by applicable and mandatory local law,\line
Customer shall not reverse-assemble, reverse-compile, reverse-engineer or in any way\line
derive any Source Code from Products that are not provided in Source Code form. Except\line
as embedded in Executable Code in Customer's Product and distributed in the ordinary\line
course of business, in no event shall Customer provide Products to Mentor Graphics\line
competitors. Log files, data files, rule files and script files generated by or for the Software\line
(collectively "Files") constitute and/or include confidential information of Mentor Graphics.\line
Customer may share Files with third parties, excluding Mentor Graphics competitors,\line
provided that the confidentiality of such Files is protected by written agreement at least as\line
well as Customer protects other information of a similar nature or importance, but in any\line
case with at least reasonable care. Under no circumstances shall Customer use Products\line
or allow their use for the purpose of developing, enhancing or marketing any product that\line
is in any way competitive with Products, or disclose to any third party the results of, or\line
information pertaining to, any benchmark.\line
5.3. Customer may not assign this Agreement or the rights and duties under it, or relocate,\line
sublicense or otherwise transfer the Products, whether by operation of law or otherwise\line
("Attempted Transfer"), without Mentor Graphics' prior written consent, which shall not\line
be unreasonably withheld, and payment of Mentor Graphics' then-current applicable relocation\line
and/or transfer fees. Any Attempted Transfer without Mentor Graphics' prior written\line
consent shall be a material breach of this Agreement and may, at Mentor Graphics' option,\line
result in the immediate termination of the Agreement and/or the licenses granted under\line
this Agreement. The terms of this Agreement, including without limitation the licensing\line
and assignment provisions, shall be binding upon Customer's permitted successors in interest\line
and assigns.\line
5.4. Notwithstanding any provision in an OSS license agreement applicable to a component of\line
the Sourcery CodeBench Software that permits the redistribution of such component to a\line
third party in Source Code or binary form, Customer may not use any Mentor Graphics\line
trademark, whether registered or unregistered, in connection with such distribution, and\line
may not recompile the Open Source Software components with the --with-pkgversion or\line
--with-bugurl configuration options that embed Mentor Graphics' trademarks in the resulting\line
binary.\line
5.5. The provisions of this Section 5 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.\line
45\line
Sourcery CodeBench Lite Licenses\line
6. Support Services.\line

any applicable Addenda to this Agreement, to the extent Customer purchases support services,\line
Mentor Graphics will provide Customer updates and technical support for the\line
number of Developers at the Development Location(s) for which support is purchased in\line
accordance with Mentor Graphics' then-current End-User Software Support Terms located\line

with Mentor Graphics or as required by the applicable Open Source license). Any other\line
distribution by Customer of the Sourcery CodeBench Software (or any component thereof)\line
in any form, including distribution permitted by the applicable Open Source license, shall\line
automatically terminate any remaining support term. Subject to the foregoing and the\line
payment of support fees, Mentor Graphics will provide Customer updates and technical\line
support for the number of Developers at the Development Location(s) for which support\line
is purchased in accordance with Mentor Graphics' then-current Sourcery CodeBench\line
Software Support Terms located at http://www.mentor.com/codebench-support-legal.\line
6.3. To the extent Customer purchases support services for Sourcery VSIPL++, Mentor\line

7. Third Party and Open Source Software. Products may contain Open Source Software or\line
code distributed under a proprietary third party license agreement. Please see applicable Products\line
documentation, including but not limited to license notice files, header files or source code for\line
further details. Please see Section B.2.2, ìComponentsî for additional rights and obligations\line
governing your use and distribution of Open Source Software. Customer agrees that it shall not\line
subject any Product provided by Mentor Graphics under this Agreement to any Open Source\line
Software license that does not otherwise apply to such Product. In the event of conflict between\line
the terms of this Agreement, any Addenda and an applicable OSS or proprietary third party\line
agreement, the OSS or proprietary third party agreement will control solely with respect to the\line
OSS or proprietary third party software component. The provisions of this Section 7 shall survive\line
the termination of this Agreement.\line
8. Limited Warranty.\line
8.1. Mentor Graphics warrants that during the warranty period its standard, generally supported\line
Products, when properly installed, will substantially conform to the functional specifications\line
set forth in the applicable user manual and/or specification. Mentor Graphics does not\line
warrant that Products will meet Customer's requirements or that operation of Products will\line
be uninterrupted or error free. The warranty period is 90 days starting on the 15th day after\line
46\line
Sourcery CodeBench Lite Licenses\line
delivery or upon installation, whichever first occurs. Customer must notify Mentor\line
Graphics in writing of any nonconformity within the warranty period. For the avoidance\line
of doubt, this warranty applies only to the initial shipment of Products under an Order and\line
does not renew or reset, for example, with the delivery of (a) Software updates or (b) authorization\line
codes. This warranty shall not be valid if Products have been subject to misuse,\line
unauthorized modification or improper installation. MENTOR GRAPHICS' ENTIRE LIABILITY\line
AND CUSTOMER'S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY SHALL BE, AT MENTOR\line
GRAPHICS' OPTION, EITHER (A) REFUND OF THE PRICE PAID UPON RETURN\line
OF THE PRODUCTS TO MENTOR GRAPHICS OR (B) MODIFICATION OR REPLACEMENT\line

PROVIDED "AS IS" UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED IN WRITING.\line
8.2. THE WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 8 ARE EXCLUSIVE TO CUSTOMER\line
AND DO NOT APPLY TO ANY END-USER. NEITHER MENTOR GRAPHICS\line
NOR ITS LICENSORS MAKE ANY OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,\line
OR STATUTORY, WITH RESPECT TO PRODUCTS OR OTHER MATERIAL\line
PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. MENTOR GRAPHICS AND ITS LICENSORS\line
SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\line
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT\line
OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.\line
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. EXCEPT WHERE THIS EXCLUSION OR RESTRICTION\line
OF LIABILITY WOULD BE VOID OR INEFFECTIVE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, AND\line
EXCEPT FOR EITHER PARTY'S BREACH OF ITS CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS,\line
CUSTOMER'S BREACH OF LICENSING TERMS OR CUSTOMER'S OBLIGATIONS\line
UNDER SECTION 10, IN NO EVENT SHALL: (A) EITHER PARTY OR ITS RESPECTIVE\line
LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL\line
DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS OR SAVINGS) WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT,\line
TORT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY OR ITS LICENSORS\line

CLAIM OR $500,000 (FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND U.S. DOLLARS). NOTWITHSTANDING\line
THE FOREGOING, IN THE CASE WHERE NO AMOUNT WAS PAID, MENTOR\line
GRAPHICS AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES\line
WHATSOEVER. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 9 SHALL SURVIVE THE TERMINATION\line
OF THIS AGREEMENT.\line
10. Hazardous Applications.\line
10.1. Customer agrees that Mentor Graphics has no control over Customer's testing or the specific\line
applications and use that Customer will make of Products. Mentor Graphics Products\line
are not specifically designed for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation\line
or communications systems, air traffic control, life support systems, medical devices or\line
other applications in which the failure of Mentor Graphics Products could lead to death,\line
personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage ("Hazardous Applications").\line
10.2. CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES IT IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR TESTING\line
PRODUCTS USED IN HAZARDOUS APPLICATIONS AND SHALL BE SOLELY\line
47\line
Sourcery CodeBench Lite Licenses\line
LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM SUCH USE. NEITHER MENTOR\line

FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF PRODUCTS IN ANY\line
HAZARDOUS APPLICATIONS.\line
10.3. CUSTOMER AGREES TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS MENTOR\line
GRAPHICS AND ITS LICENSORS FROM ANY CLAIMS, LOSS, COST, DAMAGE,\line
EXPENSE OR LIABILITY, INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES,\line
ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF PRODUCTS AS DESCRIBED\line
IN SECTION 10.1.\line
10.4. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 10 SHALL SURVIVE THE TERMINATION\line
OF THIS AGREEMENT.\line
11. Infringement.\line
11.1. Mentor Graphics will defend or settle, at its option and expense, any action brought against\line
Customer in the United States, Canada, Japan, or member state of the European Union\line
which alleges that any standard, generally supported Product acquired by Customer hereunder\line
infringes a patent or copyright or misappropriates a trade secret in such jurisdiction.\line
Mentor Graphics will pay any costs and damages finally awarded against Customer that\line
are attributable to the action. Customer understands and agrees that as conditions to\line
Mentor Graphics' obligations under this section Customer must: (a) notify Mentor Graphics\line
promptly in writing of the action; (b) provide Mentor Graphics all reasonable information\line
and assistance to settle or defend the action; and (c) grant Mentor Graphics sole authority\line
and control of the defense or settlement of the action.\line
11.2. If a claim is made under Subsection 11.1 Mentor Graphics may, at its option and expense,\line
and in addition to its obligations under Section 11.1, either (a) replace or modify the Product\line
so that it becomes noninfringing; or (b) procure for Customer the right to continue using\line
the Product. If Mentor Graphics determines that neither of those alternatives is financially\line
practical or otherwise reasonably available, Mentor Graphics may require the return of the\line
Product and refund to Customer any purchase price or license fee(s) paid.\line
11.3. Mentor Graphics has no liability to Customer if the claim is based upon: (a) the combination\line
of the Product with any product not furnished by Mentor Graphics, where the Product itself\line
is not infringing; (b) the modification of the Product other than by Mentor Graphics or as\line
directed by Mentor Graphics, where the unmodified Product would not infringe; (c) the\line
use of the infringing Product when Mentor Graphics has provided Customer with a current\line
unaltered release of a non-infringing Product of substantially similar functionality in accordance\line
with Subsection 11.2(a); (d) the use of the Product as part of an infringing process;\line
(e) a product that Customer makes, uses, or sells, where the Product itself is not infringing;\line
(f) any Product provided at no charge; (g) any software provided by Mentor Graphics' licensors\line
who do not provide such indemnification to Mentor Graphics' customers; (h) Open\line
Source Software, except to the extent that the infringement is directly caused by Mentor\line
Graphics' modifications to such Open Source Software; or (i) infringement by Customer\line
that is deemed willful. In the case of (i), Customer shall reimburse Mentor Graphics for\line
its reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs related to the action.\line
11.4. THIS SECTION 11 IS SUBJECT TO SECTION 9 ABOVE AND STATES: (A) THE\line
ENTIRE LIABILITY OF MENTOR GRAPHICS AND ITS LICENSORS AND (B)\line
CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, WITH RESPECT TO ANY ALLEGED\line
PATENT OR COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT OR TRADE SECRET MISAPPROPRIATION\line
BY ANY PRODUCT PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.\line
48\line
Sourcery CodeBench Lite Licenses\line
12. Termination and Effect of Termination. If a Software license was provided for limited term\line
use, such license will automatically terminate at the end of the authorized Term.\line
12.1. Termination for Breach. This Agreement shall remain in effect until terminated in accordance\line
with its terms. Mentor Graphics may terminate this Agreement and/or any licenses\line
granted under this Agreement, and Customer will immediately discontinue use and distribution\line
of Products, if Customer (a) commits any material breach of any provision of this\line
Agreement and fails to cure such breach upon 30-days prior written notice; or (b) becomes\line
insolvent, files a bankruptcy petition, institutes proceedings for liquidation or winding up\line
or enters into an agreement to assign its assets for the benefit of creditors. Termination of\line
this Agreement or any license granted hereunder will not affect Customer's obligation to\line
pay for Products shipped or licenses granted prior to the termination, which amounts shall\line
be payable immediately upon the date of termination. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing\line
in this Section 12 shall be construed to prevent Mentor Graphics from seeking immediate\line
injunctive relief in the event of any threatened or actual breach of Customer's obligations\line
hereunder.\line
12.2. Effect of Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement, the rights and obligations\line
of the parties shall cease except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Upon termination\line
or expiration of the Term, Customer will discontinue use and/or distribution of Products,\line
and shall return Hardware and either return to Mentor Graphics or destroy Software in\line
Customer's possession, including all copies and documentation, and certify in writing to\line
Mentor Graphics within ten business days of the termination date that Customer no longer\line
possesses any of the affected Products or copies of Software in any form, except to the\line
extent an Open Source Software license conflicts with this Section 12.2 and permits Customer's\line
continued use of any Open Source Software portion or component of a Product.\line
Upon termination for Customer's breach, an End-User may continue its use and/or distribution\line
of Customer's Product so long as: (a) the End-User was licensed according to the\line
terms of this Agreement, if applicable to such End-User, and (b) such End-User is not in\line
breach of its agreement, if applicable, nor a party to Customer's breach.\line
13. Export. The Products provided hereunder are subject to regulation by local laws and United\line
States government agencies, which prohibit export or diversion of certain products, information\line
about the products, and direct or indirect products thereof, to certain countries and certain persons.\line
Customer agrees that it will not export Products in any manner without first obtaining all necessary\line
approval from appropriate local and United States government agencies. Customer acknowledges\line
that the regulation of product export is in continuous modification by local governments\line
and/or the United States Congress and administrative agencies. Customer agrees to complete\line
all documents and to meet all requirements arising out of such modifications.\line
14. U.S. Government License Rights. Software was developed entirely at private expense. All\line
Software is commercial computer software within the meaning of the applicable acquisition\line
regulations. Accordingly, pursuant to US FAR 48 CFR 12.212 and DFAR 48 CFR 227.7202,\line
use, duplication and disclosure of the Software by or for the U.S. Government or a U.S. Government\line
subcontractor is subject solely to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,\line
except for provisions which are contrary to applicable mandatory federal laws.\line
15. Third Party Beneficiary. For any Products licensed under this Agreement and provided by\line
Customer to End-Users, Mentor Graphics or the applicable licensor is a third party beneficiary\line
of the agreement between Customer and End-User. Mentor Graphics Corporation, Mentor\line
Graphics (Ireland) Limited, and other licensors may be third party beneficiaries of this Agreement\line
with the right to enforce the obligations set forth herein.\line
16. Review of License Usage. Customer will monitor the access to and use of Software. With\line
prior written notice, during Customer's normal business hours, and no more frequently than\line
49\line
Sourcery CodeBench Lite Licenses\line
once per calendar year, Mentor Graphics may engage an internationally recognized accounting\line
firm to review Customer's software monitoring system, records, accounts and sublicensing\line
documents deemed relevant by the internationally recognized accounting firm to confirm Customer's\line
compliance with the terms of this Agreement or U.S. or other local export laws. Such\line
review may include FlexNet (or successor product) report log files that Customer shall capture\line
and provide at Mentor Graphics' request. Customer shall make records available in electronic\line
format and shall fully cooperate with data gathering to support the license review. Mentor\line
Graphics shall bear the expense of any such review unless a material non-compliance is revealed.\line
Mentor Graphics shall treat as confidential information all Customer information gained as a\line
result of any request or review and shall only use or disclose such information as required by\line
law or to enforce its rights under this Agreement. Such license review shall be at Mentor\line
Graphics' expense unless it reveals a material underpayment of fees of five percent or more, in\line
which case Customer shall reimburse Mentor Graphics for the costs of such license review.\line
Customer shall promptly pay any such fees. If the license review reveals that Customer has\line
made an overpayment, Mentor Graphics has the option to either provide the Customer with a\line
refund or credit the amount overpaid to Customer's next payment. The provisions of this Section\line
16 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.\line
17. Controlling Law, Jurisdiction and Dispute Resolution. This Agreement shall be governed\line
by and construed under the laws of the State of California, USA, excluding choice of law rules.\line
All disputes arising out of or in relation to this Agreement shall be submitted to the exclusive\line
jurisdiction of the state and federal courts of California, USA. Nothing in this section shall restrict\line
Mentor Graphics' right to bring an action (including for example a motion for injunctive relief)\line
against Customer or its Subsidiary in the jurisdiction where Customer's or its Subsidiary's place\line
of business is located. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale\line
of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.\line
18. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction\line
to be void, invalid, unenforceable or illegal, such provision shall be severed from this Agreement\line
and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.\line
19. Miscellaneous. This Agreement contains the parties' entire understanding relating to its subject\line
matter and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, including but not limited to\line
any purchase order terms and conditions. This Agreement may only be modified in writing,\line
signed by an authorized representative of each party. Waiver of terms or excuse of breach must\line
be in writing and shall not constitute subsequent consent, waiver or excuse.\line

\line
\line
THE ACCOMPANYING SOFTWARE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS AND\line
CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT ("AGREEMENT"). PLEASE REVIEW\line
THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY.  ANY USE, REPRODUCTION, MODIFICATION OR\line
DISTRIBUTION  OF  THE  PROGRAM  CONSTITUTES  ACCEPTANCE  OF  THIS\line
AGREEMENT.   IF YOU ARE AGREEING TO THIS LICENSE ON BEHALF  OF  A\line
COMPANY,  YOU  REPRESENT  THAT  YOU  ARE  AUTHORIZED  TO BIND THE\line
COMPANY TO THIS AGREEMENT.\line
\line
Cadence  Design  Systems,  Inc.  ("Cadence")  is  licensing   the\line
software  program  ("Program")  provided  hereunder under an open\line
source arrangement.  The licensee hereunder  may  use,  copy  and\line
modify  the  Program  only  pursuant  to  this  Agreement.  While\line
Cadence  encourages   any   and   all   improvements   or   other\line
modifications  made  to  the  Program  to  be  contributed to the\line
community source and thereby made available to others  under  the\line
same  terms and conditions as included in this Agreement, this is\line
not required.  However, any error corrections made to the Program\line
must be contributed to the community source.\line
\line
\line
1.      DEFINITIONS\line
\line
1.1     "Contribution"  means  the  submission  of  the  Original\line
Program  by  Cadence  and  the  submission  of any modifications,\line
improvements, additions, corrections  or  other  changes  to  the\line
Program,  including source code, object code, application program\line
interface definitions and formats, and documentation, made by any\line
Contributor  where  such  changes and/or additions to the Program\line
originate  from  and   are   distributed   by   that   particular\line
Contributor.   Each  Contributor  acknowledges and agrees that no\line
guarantee is provided  that  a  Contribution  shall  be  included\line
within   the   Program   as  distributed  by  any  Recipient.   A\line
Contribution  must  be  made  by  a  Contributor  if;  (1)   such\line
Contribution  is  an  error correction to the Program, or (2) the\line
Contributor  commercially  distributes  the  Program  with   such\line
Contribution,  in which case the Contribution must be made within\line
thirty (30) days of the commercial distribution of  the  Program.\line
"Commercially distributes" as used herein shall mean distribution\line
of the Program by a  Contributor  in  consideration  for  revenue\line
received.   A  Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it\line
was added to the Program by such  Contributor  itself  or  anyone\line
acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include\line
additions to the Program  which:  (i)  are  separate  modules  of\line
software  or  data  distributed  in  conjunction with the Program\line
under their own license agreement, and (ii)  are  not  derivative\line
works of the Program.\line
\line
1.2     "Contributor" means Cadence and  any  other  entity  that\line
distributes the Program.\line
\line
1.3     "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable  by  any\line
Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of\line
its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.\line
\line
1.4     "Original Program" means  the  original  version  of  the\line
software  accompanying  this  Agreement  as  released by Cadence,\line
including source code, object code, application program interface\line
definitions and formats, and documentation, if any.\line
\line
1.5     "Program" means the Original Program and Contributions.\line
\line
1.6     "Recipient" means anyone who receives the  Program  under\line
this Agreement, including all Contributors.\line
\line
2.      GRANT OF RIGHTS\line
\line
2.1     Subject to the terms and conditions  of  this  Agreement,\line
each  Contributor  hereby  grants each Recipient a non-exclusive,\line
worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to  reproduce,  prepare\line
derivative   works   of,   publicly  display,  publicly  perform,\line
distribute and sublicense the Contribution of  such  Contributor,\line
in source code and object code format.\line
\line
2.2     Subject to the terms and conditions  of  this  Agreement,\line
each  Contributor  hereby  grants each Recipient a non-exclusive,\line
worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents  to\line
make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the\line
Contribution of such Contributor, if  any,  in  source  code  and\line
object  code  format  along  with  any documentation. This patent\line
license shall apply to the combination of  the  Contribution  and\line
the  Program  if,  at  the  time the Contribution is added by the\line
Contributor,  such  addition  of  the  Contribution  causes  such\line
combination  to  be  covered  by the Licensed Patents. The patent\line
license shall not apply to any other combinations  which  include\line
the Contribution.\line
\line
2.3     Subject to the terms and conditions  of  this  Agreement,\line
Cadence  hereby grants each Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,\line
royalty-free trademark license, to  use  the  Cadence  trademarks\line
"LEF",  or  "DEF", in accordance with Cadenceís marking policies,\line
in connection with the license grants hereunder.\line
\line
2.4     Recipient  understands  that  although  each  Contributor\line
grants  the  licenses  to  its Contributions set forth herein, no\line
assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program  does\line
not  infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of\line
any other entity. Each Contributor  disclaims  any  liability  to\line
Recipient  for  claims  brought  by  any  other  entity  based on\line
infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise.  As  a\line
condition   to   exercising   the  rights  and  licenses  granted\line
hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole  responsibility  to\line
secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For\line
example, if a third party patent license  is  required  to  allow\line
Recipient   to   distribute   the   Program,  it  is  Recipient's\line
responsibility to acquire that license  before  distributing  the\line
Program.\line
\line
2.5     Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it  has\line
sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant\line
the copyright license set forth in  this  Agreement.   Except  as\line
expressly  stated  in  Sections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 above, Recipient\line
receives no rights or licenses to the  intellectual  property  of\line
any  Contributor  under  this  Agreement,  whether  expressly, by\line
implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not\line
expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\line
\line
\line
3.      DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS\line
\line
3.1     A Contributor may choose to  distribute  the  Program  in\line
object  code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\line
(a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this  Agreement;\line
and   (b)  the terms and conditions of its license agreement: (i)\line
effectively  disclaims  on  behalf  of   all   Contributors   all\line
warranties   and   conditions,  express  and  implied,  including\line
warranties or  conditions  of  title  and  non-infringement,  and\line
implied  warranties  or conditions of merchantability and fitness\line
for a particular purpose;\line
\line
(ii) effectively excludes  on  behalf  of  all  Contributors  all\line
liability  for  damages,  including,  but not limited to, direct,\line
indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages;\line
\line
(iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement\line
are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party;\line
and\line
\line
(iv) states that source code for the Program  is  available  from\line
such  Contributor,  and  informs  licensees how to obtain it in a\line
reasonable manner on or through a  medium  customarily  used  for\line
software exchange.\line
\line
3.2     When the Program is made available in source code form it\line
must  be  made  available  under the terms and conditions of this\line
Agreement.  A copy of this Agreement must be included  with  each\line
copy  of  such  Program.   A Contributor may not charge a fee for\line
the distribution of the source code of the Program.\line
\line
3.3     Each Contributor must preserve all  copyright  and  other\line
notices   that   appear   in  the  Program.   In  addition,  each\line
Contributor  must  identify  itself  as  the  originator  of  its\line
Contribution,   if  any,  in  a  manner  that  reasonably  allows\line
subsequent  Recipients  to  identify  the   originator   of   the\line
Contribution.\line
\line
3.4     While  this  license  is  intended  to   facilitate   the\line
commercial  use  of the Program, the Contributor who includes the\line
Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\line
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.\line
Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a  commercial\line
product  offering,  such  Contributor  ("Commercial Contributor")\line
hereby agrees to defend and  indemnify  every  other  Contributor\line
("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs\line
(collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits  and  other\line
legal  actions  brought  by a third party against the Indemnified\line
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such\line
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the\line
Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this\line
section  do  not  apply  to  any claims or Losses relating to any\line
actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to\line
qualify,  an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the\line
Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the\line
Commercial   Contributor  to  control,  and  cooperate  with  the\line
Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement\line
negotiations.  The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any\line
such claim at its own expense.\line
\line
\line
4.      NO WARRANTY\line
\line
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE  PROGRAM  IS\line
PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF\line
ANY  KIND,  EITHER  EXPRESS   OR   IMPLIED   INCLUDING,   WITHOUT\line
LIMITATION,   ANY   WARRANTIES   OR  CONDITIONS  OF  TITLE,  NON-\line
INFRINGEMENT,  MERCHANTABILITY  OR  FITNESS  FOR   A   PARTICULAR\line
PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the\line
appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes\line
all  risks  associated  with  its  exercise  of rights under this\line
Agreement, including but not limited to the risks  and  costs  of\line
program  errors,  compliance  with  applicable laws, damage to or\line
loss of  data,  programs  or  equipment,  and  unavailability  or\line
interruption of operations.\line
\line
5.      DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\line
\line
EXCEPT  AS  EXPRESSLY  SET  FORTH  IN  THIS  AGREEMENT,   NEITHER\line
RECIPIENT  NOR  ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY\line
DIRECT,   INDIRECT,   INCIDENTAL,    SPECIAL,    EXEMPLARY,    OR\line
CONSEQUENTIAL   DAMAGES   (INCLUDING   WITHOUT   LIMITATION  LOST\line
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY,  WHETHER\line
IN  CONTRACT,  STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR\line
OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR  DISTRIBUTION  OF\line
THE  PROGRAM  OR   THE  EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER,\line
EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\line
\line
6.      GENERAL\line
\line
6.1     If  any  provision  of  this  Agreement  is  invalid   or\line
unenforceable  under  applicable  law,  it  shall  not affect the\line
validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of  this\line
Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such\line
provision shall be reformed to the minimum  extent  necessary  to\line
make such provision valid and enforceable.\line
\line
6.2     If  Recipient  institutes  patent  litigation  against  a\line
Contributor  with  respect  to  a  patent  applicable to software\line
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then  any\line
patent  licenses  granted  by  that Contributor to such Recipient\line
under  this  Agreement  shall  terminate  as  of  the  date  such\line
litigation  is  filed.  If Recipient institutes patent litigation\line
against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in  a\line
lawsuit) alleging that the Program (excluding combinations of the\line
Program  with  other  software  or   hardware)   infringes   such\line
Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under\line
Section 2.2 shall terminate as of the  date  such  litigation  is\line
filed.\line
\line
6.3     If a  Commercial  Contributor  distributes  any  Program,\line
which  includes  such  Contributors  modifications, improvements,\line
additions, corrections or other  changes,  and  has  not  made  a\line
Contribution  of  such  Program,  any  licenses  granted  to such\line
Commercial Contributor under this Agreement shall terminate as of\line
the date of such Program is distributed.\line
\line
6.4     All  Recipient's  rights  under  this   Agreement   shall\line
terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or\line
conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in  a\line
reasonable   period   of   time  after  becoming  aware  of  such\line
noncompliance. If all Recipient's  rights  under  this  Agreement\line
terminate,  Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the\line
Program as soon as reasonably practicable.  However,  Recipient's\line
obligations  under  this  Agreement  and  any licenses granted by\line
Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\line
\line
6.5     Cadence may publish new versions (including revisions) of\line
this  Agreement  from  time  to  time.  Each  new  version of the\line
Agreement will be given  a  distinguishing  version  number.  The\line
Program  (including  Contributions)  may  always  be  distributed\line
subject to the version  of  the  Agreement  under  which  it  was\line
received.  In  addition,  after a new version of the Agreement is\line
published,  Contributor  may  elect  to  distribute  the  Program\line
(including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other\line
than Cadence has the right to modify this Agreement.\line
\line
6.6     This Agreement is governed by the laws of  the  State  of\line
California  and  the  intellectual  property  laws  of the United\line
States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a  legal\line
action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of\line
action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any\line
resulting litigation.\line

more of the REFERENCES, then looking at the documentation files (in roughly\line
the order listed) before diving into the code.\line
\line
\line
OVERVIEW\line
========\line
\line
This package contains C software to implement JPEG image compression and\line
decompression. JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized compression\line
method for full-color and gray-scale images. JPEG is intended for compressing\line
"real-world" scenes; line drawings, cartoons and other non-realistic images\line
are not its strong suit. JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output image is not\line
exactly identical to the input image. Hence you must not use JPEG if you\line
have to have identical output bits. However, on typical photographic images,\line
very good compression levels can be obtained with no visible change, and\line
remarkably high compression levels are possible if you can tolerate a\line
low-quality image. For more details, see the references, or just experiment\line
with various compression settings.\line
\line
This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive\line
compression processes. Provision is made for supporting all variants of these\line
processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren't implemented yet.\line
For legal reasons, we are not distributing code for the arithmetic-coding\line
variants of JPEG; see LEGAL ISSUES. We have made no provision for supporting\line
the hierarchical or lossless processes defined in the standard.\line
\line
We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files,\line
plus two sample applications "cjpeg" and "djpeg", which use the library to\line
perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats.\line
The library is intended to be reused in other applications.\line
\line
In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included\line
considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability;\line
for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG\line
decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or\line
colormapped displays. These extra functions can be compiled out of the\line
library if not required for a particular application. We have also included\line
"jpegtran", a utility for lossless transcoding between different JPEG\line
processes, and "rdjpgcom" and "wrjpgcom", two simple applications for\line
inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.\line
\line
The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and\line
flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful. In particular,\line
the software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG. (See the\line
REFERENCES section for introductory material.) Rather, it is intended to\line
be reliable, portable, industrial-strength code. We do not claim to have\line
achieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it.\line
\line
We welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products.\line
No royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement in product\line
documentation, as described under LEGAL ISSUES.\line
\line
\line
LEGAL ISSUES\line
============\line
\line
In plain English:\line
\line
1. We don't promise that this software works. (But if you find any bugs,\line
please let us know!)\line
2. You can use this software for whatever you want. You don't have to pay us.\line
3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it in a\line
program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that\line
you've used the IJG code.\line
\line
In legalese:\line
\line
The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,\line
with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or\line
fitness for a particular purpose. This software is provided "AS IS", and you,\line
its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.\line
\line
This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.\line
All Rights Reserved except as specified below.\line
\line
Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this\line
software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these\line
conditions:\line
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this\line
README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice\line
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files\line
must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.\line
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying\line
documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of\line
the Independent JPEG Group".\line
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts\line
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept\line
NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.\line
\line
These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,\line
not just to the unmodified library. If you use our work, you ought to\line
acknowledge us.\line
\line
Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name\line
in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from\line
it. This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's\line
software".\line
\line
We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of\line
commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are\line
assumed by the product vendor.\line
\line
\line
ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,\line
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.\line
ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead\line
by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,\line
that you must include source code if you redistribute it. (See the file\line
ansi2knr.c for full details.) However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part\line
of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than\line
the foregoing paragraphs do.\line
\line
The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.\line
It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.\line
The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,\line
ltconfig, ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh, is copyright\line
by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.\line
\line
It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by\line
patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Hence arithmetic coding cannot\line
legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses. For this reason,\line
support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.\line
(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented\line
Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)\line
So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining\line
code.\line
\line
The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.\line
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has\line
been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce\line
"uncompressed GIFs". This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the\line
resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard\line
GIF decoders.\line
\line
We are required to state that\line
"The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of\line
CompuServe Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of\line
CompuServe Incorporated."\line
\line
\line
REFERENCES\line
==========\line
\line
We highly recommend reading one or more of these references before trying to\line
understand the innards of the JPEG software.\line
\line
The best short technical introduction to the JPEG compression algorithm is\line
  Wallace, Gregory K. "The JPEG Still Picture Compression Standard",\line
  Communications of the ACM, April 1991 (vol. 34 no. 4), pp. 30-44.\line
(Adjacent articles in that issue discuss MPEG motion picture compression,\line
applications of JPEG, and related topics.) If you don't have the CACM issue\line
handy, a PostScript file containing a revised version of Wallace's article is\line
available at ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/wallace.ps.gz. The file (actually\line
a preprint for an article that appeared in IEEE Trans. Consumer Electronics)\line
omits the sample images that appeared in CACM, but it includes corrections\line
and some added material. Note: the Wallace article is copyright ACM and IEEE,\line
and it may not be used for commercial purposes.\line
\line
A somewhat less technical, more leisurely introduction to JPEG can be found in\line
"The Data Compression Book" by Mark Nelson and Jean-loup Gailly, published by\line
M&T Books (New York), 2nd ed. 1996, ISBN 1-55851-434-1. This book provides\line
good explanations and example C code for a multitude of compression methods\line
including JPEG. It is an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C\line
code but don't know much about data compression in general. The book's JPEG\line
sample code is far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look\line
at a full implementation, you've got one here...\line
\line
The best full description of JPEG is the textbook "JPEG Still Image Data\line
Compression Standard" by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L. Mitchell, published\line
by Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1. Price US$59.95, 638 pp.\line
The book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG standards (DIS 10918-1\line
and draft DIS 10918-2). This is by far the most complete exposition of JPEG\line
in existence, and we highly recommend it.\line
\line
The JPEG standard itself is not available electronically; you must order a\line
paper copy through ISO or ITU. (Unless you feel a need to own a certified\line
official copy, we recommend buying the Pennebaker and Mitchell book instead;\line
it's much cheaper and includes a great deal of useful explanatory material.)\line
In the USA, copies of the standard may be ordered from ANSI Sales at (212)\line
642-4900, or from Global Engineering Documents at (800) 854-7179. (ANSI\line
doesn't take credit card orders, but Global does.) It's not cheap: as of\line
1992, ANSI was charging $95 for Part 1 and $47 for Part 2, plus 7%\line
shipping/handling. The standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the\line
actual specification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods. Part 1\line
is titled "Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images,\line
Part 1: Requirements and guidelines" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS\line
10918-1, ITU-T T.81. Part 2 is titled "Digital Compression and Coding of\line
Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 2: Compliance testing" and has document\line
numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83.\line
\line
Some extensions to the original JPEG standard are defined in JPEG Part 3,\line
a newer ISO standard numbered ISO/IEC IS 10918-3 and ITU-T T.84. IJG\line
currently does not support any Part 3 extensions.\line
\line
The JPEG standard does not specify all details of an interchangeable file\line
format. For the omitted details we follow the "JFIF" conventions, revision\line
1.02. A copy of the JFIF spec is available from:\line
  Literature Department\line
  C-Cube Microsystems, Inc.\line
  1778 McCarthy Blvd.\line
  Milpitas, CA 95035\line

A PostScript version of this document is available by FTP at\line
ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jfif.ps.gz. There is also a plain text\line
version at ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jfif.txt.gz, but it is missing\line
the figures.\line
\line
The TIFF 6.0 file format specification can be obtained by FTP from\line
ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.gz. The JPEG incorporation scheme\line
found in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious problems.\line
IJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression tag 6).\line
Instead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technical Note #2\line
(Compression tag 7). Copies of this Note can be obtained from ftp.sgi.com or\line
from ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/. It is expected that the next revision\line
of the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note's design.\line
Although IJG's own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff library\line
uses our library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note. libtiff is available\line
from ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/.\line
\line
\line
ARCHIVE LOCATIONS\line
=================\line
\line
The "official" archive site for this software is ftp.uu.net (Internet\line
address 192.48.96.9). The most recent released version can always be found\line
there in directory graphics/jpeg. This particular version will be archived\line
as ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz. If you don't have\line
direct Internet access, UUNET's archives are also available via UUCP; contact\line
help@uunet.uu.net for information on retrieving files that way.\line
\line
Numerous Internet sites maintain copies of the UUNET files. However, only\line
ftp.uu.net is guaranteed to have the latest official version.\line
\line
You can also obtain this software in DOS-compatible "zip" archive format from\line
the SimTel archives (ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/msdos/graphics/), or\line
on CompuServe in the Graphics Support forum (GO CIS:GRAPHSUP), library 12\line
"JPEG Tools". Again, these versions may sometimes lag behind the ftp.uu.net\line
release.\line
\line
The JPEG FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) article is a useful source of\line
general information about JPEG. It is updated constantly and therefore is\line
not included in this distribution. The FAQ is posted every two weeks to\line
Usenet newsgroups comp.graphics.misc, news.answers, and other groups.\line
It is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.faqs.org/faqs/jpeg-faq/\line
and other news.answers archive sites, including the official news.answers\line
archive at rtfm.mit.edu: ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/.\line
If you don't have Web or FTP access, send e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu\line

  send usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/part2\line
\line
\line
RELATED SOFTWARE\line
================\line
\line
Numerous viewing and image manipulation programs now support JPEG. (Quite a\line
few of them use this library to do so.) The JPEG FAQ described above lists\line
some of the more popular free and shareware viewers, and tells where to\line
obtain them on Internet.\line
\line
If you are on a Unix machine, we highly recommend Jef Poskanzer's free\line
PBMPLUS software, which provides many useful operations on PPM-format image\line
files. In particular, it can convert PPM images to and from a wide range of\line
other formats, thus making cjpeg/djpeg considerably more useful. The latest\line
version is distributed by the NetPBM group, and is available from numerous\line
sites, notably ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/graphics/graphics/packages/NetPBM/.\line
Unfortunately PBMPLUS/NETPBM is not nearly as portable as the IJG software is;\line
you are likely to have difficulty making it work on any non-Unix machine.\line
\line
A different free JPEG implementation, written by the PVRG group at Stanford,\line
is available from ftp://havefun.stanford.edu/pub/jpeg/. This program\line
is designed for research and experimentation rather than production use;\line
it is slower, harder to use, and less portable than the IJG code, but it\line
is easier to read and modify. Also, the PVRG code supports lossless JPEG,\line
which we do not. (On the other hand, it doesn't do progressive JPEG.)\line
\line
\line
FILE FORMAT WARS\line
================\line
\line
Some JPEG programs produce files that are not compatible with our library.\line
The root of the problem is that the ISO JPEG committee failed to specify a\line
concrete file format. Some vendors "filled in the blanks" on their own,\line
creating proprietary formats that no one else could read. (For example, none\line
of the early commercial JPEG implementations for the Macintosh were able to\line
exchange compressed files.)\line
\line
The file format we have adopted is called JFIF (see REFERENCES). This format\line
has been agreed to by a number of major commercial JPEG vendors, and it has\line
become the de facto standard. JFIF is a minimal or "low end" representation.\line
We recommend the use of TIFF/JPEG (TIFF revision 6.0 as modified by TIFF\line
Technical Note #2) for "high end" applications that need to record a lot of\line
additional data about an image. TIFF/JPEG is fairly new and not yet widely\line
supported, unfortunately.\line
\line
The upcoming JPEG Part 3 standard defines a file format called SPIFF.\line
SPIFF is interoperable with JFIF, in the sense that most JFIF decoders should\line
be able to read the most common variant of SPIFF. SPIFF has some technical\line
advantages over JFIF, but its major claim to fame is simply that it is an\line
official standard rather than an informal one. At this point it is unclear\line
whether SPIFF will supersede JFIF or whether JFIF will remain the de-facto\line
standard. IJG intends to support SPIFF once the standard is frozen, but we\line
have not decided whether it should become our default output format or not.\line
(In any case, our decoder will remain capable of reading JFIF indefinitely.)\line
\line
Various proprietary file formats incorporating JPEG compression also exist.\line
We have little or no sympathy for the existence of these formats. Indeed,\line
one of the original reasons for developing this free software was to help\line
force convergence on common, open format standards for JPEG files. Don't\line
use a proprietary file format!\line
\line
\line
TO DO\line
=====\line
\line
The major thrust for v7 will probably be improvement of visual quality.\line
The current method for scaling the quantization tables is known not to be\line
very good at low Q values. We also intend to investigate block boundary\line
smoothing, "poor man's variable quantization", and other means of improving\line
quality-vs-file-size performance without sacrificing compatibility.\line
\line
In future versions, we are considering supporting some of the upcoming JPEG\line
Part 3 extensions --- principally, variable quantization and the SPIFF file\line
format.\line
\line
As always, speeding things up is of great interest.\line

LEGAL ISSUES\line
============\line
\line
In plain English:\line
\line
1. We don't promise that this software works. (But if you find any bugs, please let us know!)\line
\line
2. You can use this software for whatever you want. You don't have to pay us.\line
\line
3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you've used the IJG code.\line
\line
In legalese:\line
\line
The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied, with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose. This software is provided "AS IS", and you, its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.\line
\line
This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.  All Rights Reserved except as specified below.\line
\line
Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these conditions:\line
\line
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.\line
\line
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group".\line
\line
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.\line
\line
These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code, not just to the unmodified library. If you use our work, you ought to acknowledge us.\line
\line
Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from it. This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's software".\line
\line
We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are assumed by the product vendor.\line
\line
ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.  ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally, that you must include source code if you redistribute it. (See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.) However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do.\line
\line
The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.  It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.  The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.\line
\line
It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Hence arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses. For this reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.  (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)  So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining code.\line
\line
The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.  To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce "uncompressed GIFs". This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.\line
\line
We are required to state that "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated."\line

This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December 31 2002.  This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this license can be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, reflects that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use". Otherwise, this version is the same as the previous version and is written so as to preserve the Free Software Foundation's assessment of GPL compatibility and OSI's certification under the Open Source Definition. Please see our Copyright FAQ for common questions about using materials from our site, including specific terms and conditions for packages like libwww, Amaya, and Jigsaw. Other questions about this notice can be directed to site-policy@w3.org.\line

Note that the only valid version of the GPL as far as this project\line
 is concerned is _this_ particular version of the license (ie v2, not\line
 v2.2 or v3.x or whatever), unless explicitly otherwise stated.\line
\line
 HOWEVER, in order to allow a migration to GPLv3 if that seems like\line
 a good idea, I also ask that people involved with the project make\line
 their preferences known. In particular, if you trust me to make that\line
 decision, you might note so in your copyright message, ie something\line
 like\line
\line
	This file is licensed under the GPL v2, or a later version\line
	at the discretion of Linus.\line
\line
  might avoid issues. But we can also just decide to synchronize and\line
  contact all copyright holders on record if/when the occasion arises.\line

ansi2knr is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY\line
WARRANTY. No author or distributor accepts responsibility to anyone for the\line
consequences of using it or for whether it serves any particular purpose or\line
works at all, unless he says so in writing. Refer to the GNU General Public\line
License (the "GPL") for full details.\line
\line
Everyone is granted permission to copy, modify and redistribute ansi2knr,\line
but only under the conditions described in the GPL. A copy of this license\line
is supposed to have been given to you along with ansi2knr so you can know\line
your rights and responsibilities. It should be in a file named COPYLEFT,\line
or, if there is no file named COPYLEFT, a file named COPYING. Among other\line
things, the copyright notice and this notice must be preserved on all\line
copies.\line
\line
We explicitly state here what we believe is already implied by the GPL: if\line
the ansi2knr program is distributed as a separate set of sources and a\line
separate executable file which are aggregated on a storage medium together\line
with another program, this in itself does not bring the other program under\line
the GPL, nor does the mere fact that such a program or the procedures for\line
constructing it invoke the ansi2knr executable bring any other part of the\line
program under the GPL.\line

\line
 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\line
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\line
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\line
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\line
\line
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts\line
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\line
 the version number 2.1.]\line
\line
                            Preamble\line
\line
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\line
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\line
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\line
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\line
\line
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\line
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\line
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\line
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\line
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\line
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\line
\line
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\line
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\line
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\line
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\line
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\line
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\line
these things.\line
\line
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\line
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\line
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\line
\line
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\line
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\line
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\line
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line
\line
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\line
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\line
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line
\line
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\line
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\line
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\line
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\line
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\line
introduced by others.\line
\line
\line
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\line
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\line
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\line
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\line
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\line
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\line
\line
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\line
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\line
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\line
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\line
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\line
libraries into non-free programs.\line
\line
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\line
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\line
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\line
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\line
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\line
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\line
the library.\line
\line
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\line
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\line
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\line
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\line
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\line
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\line
special circumstances.\line
\line
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\line
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\line
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\line
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\line
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\line
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\line
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\line
\line
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\line
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\line
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\line
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\line
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\line
system.\line
\line
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\line
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\line
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\line
that program using a modified version of the Library.\line
\line
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\line
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\line
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\line
be combined with the library in order to run.\line
\line
\line
                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line
\line
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\line
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\line
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\line
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").\line
Each licensee is addressed as "you".\line
\line
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\line
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\line
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\line
\line
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\line
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\line
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\line
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\line
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\line
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\line
included without limitation in the term "modification".)\line
\line
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\line
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\line
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\line
and installation of the library.\line
\line
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\line
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\line
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\line
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\line
and what the program that uses the Library does.\line
\line
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\line
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\line
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\line
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\line
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\line
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\line
Library.\line
\line
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\line
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\line
fee.\line
\line
\line
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\line
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\line
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line
\line
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\line
\line
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\line
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line
\line
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\line
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\line
\line
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\line
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\line
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\line
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\line
    in the event an application does not supply such function or\line
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\line
    its purpose remains meaningful.\line
\line
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\line
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\line
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\line
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\line
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\line
    root function must still compute square roots.)\line
\line
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\line
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\line
it.\line
\line
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line
collective works based on the Library.\line
\line
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\line
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\line
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line
the scope of this License.\line
\line
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\line
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\line
these notices.\line
\line
\line
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line
\line
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line
the Library into a program that is not a library.\line
\line
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line
medium customarily used for software interchange.\line
\line
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line
\line
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\line
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line
\line
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line
\line
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\line
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line
\line
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line
Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line
\line
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line
\line
\line
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\line
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line
engineering for debugging such modifications.\line
\line
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\line
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\line
of these things:\line
\line
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\line
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line
    to use the modified definitions.)\line
\line
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\line
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\line
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\line
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\line
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\line
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\line
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\line
\line
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\line
    least three years, to give the same user the materials\line
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\line
    than the cost of performing this distribution.\line
\line
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line
    specified materials from the same place.\line
\line
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line
\line
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\line
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\line
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line
the executable.\line
\line
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\line
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line
distribute.\line
\line
\line
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\line
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\line
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\line
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\line
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\line
\line
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\line
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\line
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\line
    Sections above.\line
\line
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\line
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\line
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line
\line
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\line
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\line
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\line
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\line
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\line
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\line
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\line
\line
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\line
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\line
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line
the Library or works based on it.\line
\line
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\line
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\line
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\line
this License.\line
\line
\line
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\line
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\line
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\line
\line
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\line
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\line
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\line
\line
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line
integrity of the free software distribution system which is\line
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\line
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line
impose that choice.\line
\line
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line
be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line
\line
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\line
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\line
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\line
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\line
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\line
written in the body of this License.\line
\line
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\line
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\line
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\line
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line
\line
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\line
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\line
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\line
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\line
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\line
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\line
the Free Software Foundation.\line
\line
\line
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\line
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\line
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\line
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\line
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\line
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\line
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\line
and reuse of software generally.\line
\line
                            NO WARRANTY\line
\line
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\line
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\line
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\line
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\line
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\line
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\line
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\line
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\line
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line
\line
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\line
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\line
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\line
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\line
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\line
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\line
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\line
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\line
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\line
DAMAGES.\line
\line
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line
\line
\line
           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\line
\line
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\line
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\line
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\line
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\line
ordinary General Public License).\line
\line
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\line
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\line
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\line
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\line
\line
    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\line
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\line
\line
    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\line
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\line
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\line
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\line
\line
    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\line
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\line
    Lesser General Public License for more details.\line
\line
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\line
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\line
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\line
\line
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\line
\line
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\line
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if\line
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\line
\line
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\line
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.\line
\line
  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990\line

          infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by\line
          that Contributor.\line
\line
3. Distribution Obligations.\line
\line
     3.1. Application of License.\line
     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are\line
     governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation\line
     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be\line
     distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version\line
     of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a\line
     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You\line
     distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code\line
     version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this\line
     License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include\line
     an additional document offering the additional rights described in\line
     Section 3.5.\line
\line
     3.2. Availability of Source Code.\line
     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be\line
     made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License\line
     either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted\line
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an\line
     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic\line
     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)\line
     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six\line
     (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification\line
     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for\line
     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the\line
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\line
\line
     3.3. Description of Modifications.\line
     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a\line
     file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and\line
     the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that\line
     the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original\line
     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the\line
     Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an\line
     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the\line
     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\line
\line
     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\line
          (a) Third Party Claims.\line
          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's\line
          intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights\line
          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,\line
          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code\line
          distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the\line
          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will\line
          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after\line
          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,\line
          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies\line
          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps\line
          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)\line
          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered\line
          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\line
\line
          (b) Contributor APIs.\line
          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming\line
          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which\line
          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must\line
          also include this information in the LEGAL file.\line
\line
               (c)    Representations.\line
          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to\line
          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's\line
          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or\line
          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by\line
          this License.\line
\line
     3.5. Required Notices.\line
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source\line
     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source\line
     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a\line
     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely\line
     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)\line
     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in\line
     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation\line
     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership\line
     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to\line
     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability\line
     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You\line
     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial\line
     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than\line
     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is\line
     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\line
     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the\line
     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,\line
     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\line
\line
     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\line
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\line
     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,\line
     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of\line
     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,\line
     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the\line
     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included\line
     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or\line
     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the\line
     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered\line
     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may\line
     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in\line
     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the\line
     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's\line
     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this\line
     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different\line
     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ\line
     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial\line
     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the\line
     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by\line
     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such\line
     terms You offer.\line
\line
     3.7. Larger Works.\line
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code\line
     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger\line
     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the\line
     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\line
\line
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\line
\line
     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\line
     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to\line
     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\line
     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\line
     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description\line
     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must\line
     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the\line
     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\line
     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\line
     understand it.\line
\line
5. Application of this License.\line
\line
     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\line
     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\line
\line
6. Versions of the License.\line
\line
     6.1. New Versions.\line
     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised\line
     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version\line
     will be given a distinguishing version number.\line
\line
     6.2. Effect of New Versions.\line
     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the\line
     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that\line
     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms\line
     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one\line
     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to\line
     Covered Code created under this License.\line
\line
     6.3. Derivative Works.\line
     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may\line
     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code\line
     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that\line
     the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",\line
     "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your\line
     license (except to note that your license differs from this License)\line
     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license\line
     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and\line
     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial\line
     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in\line
     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of\line
     this License.)\line
\line
7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\line
\line
     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,\line
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\line
     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF\line
     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.\line
     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE\line
     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,\line
     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE\line
     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER\line
     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF\line
     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\line
\line
8. TERMINATION.\line
\line
     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\line
     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\line
     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All\line
     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall\line
     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their\line
     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License\line
     shall survive.\line
\line
     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement\line
     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer\line
     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom\line
     You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:\line
\line
     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly\line
     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such\line
     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License\line
     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,\line
     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)\line
     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable\line
     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such\line
     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to\line
     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days\line
     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not\line
     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim\line
     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under\line
     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of\line
     the 60 day notice period specified above.\line
\line
     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's\line
     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then\line
     any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)\line
     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,\line
     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that\line
     Participant.\line
\line
     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\line
     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or\line
     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as\line
     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\line
     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\line
     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\line
     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\line
     license.\line
\line
     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,\line
     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)\line
     which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder\line
     prior to termination shall survive termination.\line
\line
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\line
\line
     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\line
     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL\line
     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,\line
     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR\line
     ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY\line
     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,\line
     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\line
     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\line
     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\line
     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\line
     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\line
     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\line
     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO\line
     THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\line
\line
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\line
\line
     The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in\line
     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer\line
     software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such\line
     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48\line
     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),\line
     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those\line
     rights set forth herein.\line
\line
11. MISCELLANEOUS.\line
\line
     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\line
     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\line
     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\line
     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by\line
     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if\line
     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.\line
     With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,\line
     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United\line
     States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be\line
     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern\line
     District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,\line
     California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including\line
     without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and\line
     expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on\line
     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\line
     Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract\line
     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this\line
     License.\line
\line
12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\line
\line
     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\line
     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,\line
     out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to\line
     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such\line
     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or\line
     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\line
\line
13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\line
\line
     Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as\line
     "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial\line
     Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under\line
     Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified\line
     by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.\line

==========================\line
\line
   UPX and the UCL library are free software; you can redistribute them\line
   and/or modify them under the terms of the GNU General Public License as\line
   published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of\line
   the License, or (at your option) any later version.\line

   but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line
   MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\line

\line
\line
SPECIAL EXCEPTION FOR COMPRESSED EXECUTABLES\line
============================================\line
\line
   The stub which is imbedded in each UPX compressed program is part\line
   of UPX and UCL, and contains code that is under our copyright. The\line
   terms of the GNU General Public License still apply as compressing\line
   a program is a special form of linking with our stub.\line
\line
   Hereby Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer and Laszlo Molnar grant you special\line
   permission to freely use and distribute all UPX compressed programs\line
   (including commercial ones), subject to the following restrictions:\line
\line
   1. You must compress your program with a completely unmodified UPX\line
      version; either with our precompiled version, or (at your option)\line
      with a self compiled version of the unmodified UPX sources as\line
      distributed by us.\line
   2. This also implies that the UPX stub must be completely unmodfied, i.e.\line
      the stub imbedded in your compressed program must be byte-identical\line
      to the stub that is produced by the official unmodified UPX version.\line
   3. The decompressor and any other code from the stub must exclusively get\line
      used by the unmodified UPX stub for decompressing your program at\line
      program startup. No portion of the stub may get read, copied,\line
      called or otherwise get used or accessed by your program.\line
\line
\line
ANNOTATIONS\line
===========\line
\line
  - You can use a modified UPX version or modified UPX stub only for\line
    programs that are compatible with the GNU General Public License.\line
\line
  - We grant you special permission to freely use and distribute all UPX\line
    compressed programs. But any modification of the UPX stub (such as,\line
    but not limited to, removing our copyright string or making your\line
    program non-decompressible) will immediately revoke your right to\line
    use and distribute a UPX compressed program.\line
\line
  - UPX is not a software protection tool; by requiring that you use\line
    the unmodified UPX version for your proprietary programs we\line
    make sure that any user can decompress your program. This protects\line
    both you and your users as nobody can hide malicious code -\line
    any program that cannot be decompressed is highly suspicious\line
    by definition.\line
\line
  - You can integrate all or part of UPX and UCL into projects that\line
    are compatible with the GNU GPL, but obviously you cannot grant\line
    any special exceptions beyond the GPL for our code in your project.\line
\line
  - We want to actively support manufacturers of virus scanners and\line
    similar security software. Please contact us if you would like to\line
    incorporate parts of UPX or UCL into such a product.\line

      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but\line
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,\line
      and conversions to other media types.\line
\line
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or\line
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a\line
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work\line
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\line
\line
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\line
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\line
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\line
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\line
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\line
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\line
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\line
\line
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including\line
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\line

      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but\line

      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and\line

      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\line
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\line

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\line
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\line
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\line
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\line
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\line
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\line
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\line
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\line
      as of the date such litigation is filed.\line
\line
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\line
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\line
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\line
      meet the following conditions:\line
\line
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\line
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\line
\line
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\line
          stating that You changed the files; and\line
\line
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\line
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\line
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\line
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\line
          the Derivative Works; and\line
\line
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\line
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\line
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\line
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\line
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\line
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\line
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\line
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\line
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\line
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\line
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\line
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\line
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\line
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\line
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\line
          as modifying the License.\line
\line
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\line
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\line
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\line
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\line
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\line
      the conditions stated in this License.\line
\line
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\line
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\line
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\line
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\line
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\line
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\line
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\line
\line
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\line
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\line
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\line
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\line
\line
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\line
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\line
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\line
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\line
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\line
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\line
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\line
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\line
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\line
\line
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\line
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\line
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\line
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\line
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\line
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\line
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\line
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\line
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\line
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\line
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\line
\line
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\line
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\line
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\line
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\line
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\line
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\line
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\line
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\line
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\line
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\line
\line
   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\line
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\line
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\line
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\line
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\line
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\line
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\line
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\line
      as of the date such litigation is filed.\line
\line
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\line
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\line
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\line
      meet the following conditions:\line
\line
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\line
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\line
\line
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\line
          stating that You changed the files; and\line
\line
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\line
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\line
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\line
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\line
          the Derivative Works; and\line
\line
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\line
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\line
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\line
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\line
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\line
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\line
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\line
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\line
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\line
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\line
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\line
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\line
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\line
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\line
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\line
          as modifying the License.\line
\line
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\line
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\line
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\line
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\line
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\line
      the conditions stated in this License.\line
\line
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\line
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\line
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\line
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\line
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\line
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\line
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\line
\line
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\line
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\line
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\line
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\line
\line
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\line
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\line
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\line
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\line
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\line
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\line
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\line
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\line
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\line
\line
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\line
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\line
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\line
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\line
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\line
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\line
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\line
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\line
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\line
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\line
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\line
\line
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\line
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\line
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\line
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\line
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\line
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\line
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\line
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\line
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\line
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\line

Use of any of this software is governed by the terms of the license below: \line
             \line
 GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line
\line
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which\line
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized\line
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library\line
General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is\line
addressed as "you".\line
\line
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\line
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\line
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\line
\line
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\line
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\line
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\line
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\line
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\line
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\line
included without limitation in the term "modification".)\line
\line
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\line
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\line
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\line
and installation of the library.\line
\line
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\line
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\line
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\line
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\line
and what the program that uses the Library does.\line
\line
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\line
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\line
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\line
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\line
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\line
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\line
Library.\line
\line
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\line
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\line
fee.\line
\line
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\line
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\line
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line
\line
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\line
\line
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\line
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line
\line
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\line
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\line
\line
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\line
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\line
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\line
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\line
    in the event an application does not supply such function or\line
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\line
    its purpose remains meaningful.\line
\line
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\line
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\line
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\line
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\line
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\line
    root function must still compute square roots.)\line
\line
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\line
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\line
it.\line
\line
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line
collective works based on the Library.\line
\line
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\line
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\line
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line
the scope of this License.\line
\line
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\line
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\line
these notices.\line
\line
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line
\line
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line
the Library into a program that is not a library.\line
\line
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line
medium customarily used for software interchange.\line
\line
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line
\line
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\line
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line
\line
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line
\line
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\line
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line
\line
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line
Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line
\line
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line
\line
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or\line
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line
engineering for debugging such modifications.\line
\line
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\line
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\line
of these things:\line
\line
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\line
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line
    to use the modified definitions.)\line
\line
    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\line
    least three years, to give the same user the materials\line
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\line
    than the cost of performing this distribution.\line
\line
    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line
    specified materials from the same place.\line
\line
    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line
\line
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\line
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally\line
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line
the executable.\line
\line
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\line
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line
distribute.\line
\line
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\line
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\line
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\line
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\line
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\line
\line
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\line
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\line
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\line
    Sections above.\line
\line
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\line
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\line
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line
\line
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\line
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\line
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\line
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\line
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\line
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\line
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\line
\line
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\line
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\line
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line
the Library or works based on it.\line
\line
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\line
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\line
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\line
this License.\line
\line
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\line
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\line
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\line
\line
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\line
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\line
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\line
\line
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line
integrity of the free software distribution system which is\line
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\line
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line
impose that choice.\line
\line
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line
be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line
\line
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\line
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\line
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\line
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\line
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\line
written in the body of this License.\line
\line
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\line
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.\line
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\line
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line
\line
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\line
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\line
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\line
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\line
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\line
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\line
the Free Software Foundation.\line
\line
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\line
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\line
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\line
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\line
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\line
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\line
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\line
and reuse of software generally.\line
\line
                            NO WARRANTY\line
\line
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\line
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\line
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\line
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\line
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\line
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\line
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\line
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\line
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line
\line
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\line
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\line
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\line
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\line
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\line
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\line
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\line
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\line
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\line
DAMAGES.\line

 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\line
 the version number 2.1.]\line
\line
                            Preamble\line
\line
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\line
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\line
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\line
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\line
\line
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\line
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\line
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\line
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\line
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\line
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\line
\line
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\line
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\line
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\line
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\line
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\line
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\line
these things.\line
\line
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\line
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\line
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\line
\line
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\line
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\line
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\line
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line
\line
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\line
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\line
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line
\line
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\line
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\line
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\line
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\line
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\line
introduced by others.\line
\line
\line
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\line
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\line
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\line
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\line
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\line
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\line
\line
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\line
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\line
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\line
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\line
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\line
libraries into non-free programs.\line
\line
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\line
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\line
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\line
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\line
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\line
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\line
the library.\line
\line
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\line
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\line
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\line
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\line
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\line
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\line
special circumstances.\line
\line
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\line
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\line
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\line
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\line
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\line
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\line
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\line
\line
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\line
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\line
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\line
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\line
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\line
system.\line
\line
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\line
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\line
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\line
that program using a modified version of the Library.\line
\line
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\line
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\line
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\line
be combined with the library in order to run.\line
\line
\line
                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line
\line
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\line
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\line
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\line
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").\line
Each licensee is addressed as "you".\line
\line
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\line
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\line
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\line
\line
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\line
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\line
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\line
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\line
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\line
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\line
included without limitation in the term "modification".)\line
\line
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\line
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\line
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\line
and installation of the library.\line
\line
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\line
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\line
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\line
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\line
and what the program that uses the Library does.\line
\line
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\line
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\line
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\line
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\line
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\line
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\line
Library.\line
\line
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\line
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\line
fee.\line
\line
\line
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\line
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\line
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line
\line
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\line
\line
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\line
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line
\line
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\line
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\line
\line
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\line
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\line
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\line
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\line
    in the event an application does not supply such function or\line
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\line
    its purpose remains meaningful.\line
\line
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\line
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\line
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\line
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\line
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\line
    root function must still compute square roots.)\line
\line
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\line
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\line
it.\line
\line
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line
collective works based on the Library.\line
\line
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\line
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\line
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line
the scope of this License.\line
\line
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\line
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\line
these notices.\line
\line
\line
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line
\line
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line
the Library into a program that is not a library.\line
\line
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line
medium customarily used for software interchange.\line
\line
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line
\line
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\line
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line
\line
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line
\line
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\line
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line
\line
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line
Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line
\line
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line
\line
\line
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\line
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line
engineering for debugging such modifications.\line
\line
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\line
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\line
of these things:\line
\line
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\line
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line
    to use the modified definitions.)\line
\line
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\line
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\line
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\line
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\line
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\line
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\line
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\line
\line
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\line
    least three years, to give the same user the materials\line
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\line
    than the cost of performing this distribution.\line
\line
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line
    specified materials from the same place.\line
\line
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line
\line
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\line
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\line
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line
the executable.\line
\line
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\line
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line
distribute.\line
\line
\line
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\line
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\line
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\line
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\line
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\line
\line
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\line
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\line
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\line
    Sections above.\line
\line
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\line
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\line
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line
\line
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\line
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\line
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\line
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\line
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\line
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\line
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\line
\line
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\line
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\line
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line
the Library or works based on it.\line
\line
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\line
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\line
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\line
this License.\line
\line
\line
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\line
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\line
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\line
\line
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\line
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\line
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\line
\line
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line
integrity of the free software distribution system which is\line
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\line
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line
impose that choice.\line
\line
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line
be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line
\line
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\line
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\line
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\line
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\line
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\line
written in the body of this License.\line
\line
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\line
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\line
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\line
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line
\line
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\line
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\line
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\line
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\line
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\line
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\line
the Free Software Foundation.\line
\line
\line
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\line
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\line
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\line
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\line
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\line
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\line
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\line
and reuse of software generally.\line
\line
                            NO WARRANTY\line
\line
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\line
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\line
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\line
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\line
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\line
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\line
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\line
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\line
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line
\line
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\line
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\line
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\line
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\line
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\line
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\line
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\line
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\line
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\line
DAMAGES.\line
\line
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line
\line
\line
           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\line
\line
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\line
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\line
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\line
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\line
ordinary General Public License).\line
\line
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\line
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\line
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\line
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\line
\line
    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\line
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\line
\line
    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\line
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\line
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\line
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\line
\line
    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\line
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\line
    Lesser General Public License for more details.\line
\line
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\line
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\line
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\line
\line
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\line
\line
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\line
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if\line
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\line
\line
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\line
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.\line

\line
          (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are\line
          effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes\line
          Original Code under the terms of this License.\line
\line
          (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is\line
          granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2)\line
          separate from the Original Code;  or 3) for infringements caused\line
          by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the\line
          combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.\line
\line
     2.2. Contributor Grant.\line
     Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor\line
     hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license\line
\line
          (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or\line
          trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,\line
          display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications\line
          created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an\line

          and/or as part of a Larger Work; and\line
\line
          (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or\line
          selling of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone\line

          of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have\line
          made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that\line

          Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims\line
          infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by\line
          that Contributor.\line
\line
3. Distribution Obligations.\line
\line
     3.1. Application of License.\line
     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are\line
     governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation\line
     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be\line
     distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version\line
     of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a\line
     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You\line
     distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code\line
     version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this\line
     License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include\line
     an additional document offering the additional rights described in\line
     Section 3.5.\line
\line
     3.2. Availability of Source Code.\line
     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be\line
     made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License\line
     either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted\line
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an\line
     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic\line
     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)\line
     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six\line
     (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification\line
     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for\line
     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the\line
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\line
\line
     3.3. Description of Modifications.\line
     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a\line
     file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and\line
     the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that\line
     the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original\line
     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the\line
     Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an\line
     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the\line
     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\line
\line
     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\line
          (a) Third Party Claims.\line
          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's\line
          intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights\line
          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,\line
          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code\line
          distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the\line
          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will\line
          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after\line
          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,\line
          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies\line
          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps\line
          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)\line
          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered\line
          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\line
\line
          (b) Contributor APIs.\line
          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming\line
          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which\line
          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must\line
          also include this information in the LEGAL file.\line
\line
               (c)    Representations.\line
          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to\line
          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's\line
          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or\line
          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by\line
          this License.\line
\line
     3.5. Required Notices.\line
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source\line
     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source\line
     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a\line
     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely\line
     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)\line
     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in\line
     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation\line
     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership\line
     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to\line
     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability\line
     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You\line
     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial\line
     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than\line
     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is\line
     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\line
     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the\line
     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,\line
     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\line
\line
     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\line
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\line
     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,\line
     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of\line
     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,\line
     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the\line
     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included\line
     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or\line
     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the\line
     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered\line
     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may\line
     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in\line
     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the\line
     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's\line
     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this\line
     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different\line
     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ\line
     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial\line
     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the\line
     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by\line
     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such\line
     terms You offer.\line
\line
     3.7. Larger Works.\line
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code\line
     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger\line
     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the\line
     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\line
\line
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\line
\line
     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\line
     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to\line
     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\line
     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\line
     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description\line
     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must\line
     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the\line
     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\line
     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\line
     understand it.\line
\line
5. Application of this License.\line
\line
     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\line
     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\line
\line
6. Versions of the License.\line
\line
     6.1. New Versions.\line
     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised\line
     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version\line
     will be given a distinguishing version number.\line
\line
     6.2. Effect of New Versions.\line
     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the\line
     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that\line
     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms\line
     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one\line
     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to\line
     Covered Code created under this License.\line
\line
     6.3. Derivative Works.\line
     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may\line
     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code\line
     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that\line
     the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",\line
     "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your\line
     license (except to note that your license differs from this License)\line
     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license\line
     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and\line
     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial\line
     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in\line
     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of\line
     this License.)\line
\line
7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\line
\line
     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,\line
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\line
     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF\line
     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.\line
     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE\line
     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,\line
     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE\line
     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER\line
     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF\line
     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\line
\line
8. TERMINATION.\line
\line
     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\line
     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\line
     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All\line
     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall\line
     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their\line
     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License\line
     shall survive.\line
\line
     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement\line
     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer\line
     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom\line
     You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:\line
\line
     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly\line
     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such\line
     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License\line
     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,\line
     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)\line
     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable\line
     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such\line
     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to\line
     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days\line
     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not\line
     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim\line
     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under\line
     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of\line
     the 60 day notice period specified above.\line
\line
     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's\line
     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then\line
     any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)\line
     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,\line
     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that\line
     Participant.\line
\line
     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\line
     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or\line
     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as\line
     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\line
     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\line
     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\line
     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\line
     license.\line
\line
     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,\line
     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)\line
     which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder\line
     prior to termination shall survive termination.\line
\line
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\line
\line
     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\line
     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL\line
     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,\line
     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR\line
     ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY\line
     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,\line
     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\line
     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\line
     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\line
     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\line
     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\line
     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\line
     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO\line
     THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\line
\line
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\line
\line
     The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in\line
     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer\line
     software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such\line
     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48\line
     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),\line
     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those\line
     rights set forth herein.\line
\line
11. MISCELLANEOUS.\line
\line
     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\line
     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\line
     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\line
     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by\line
     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if\line
     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.\line
     With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,\line
     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United\line
     States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be\line
     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern\line
     District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,\line
     California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including\line
     without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and\line
     expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on\line
     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\line
     Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract\line
     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this\line
     License.\line
\line
12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\line
\line
     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\line
     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,\line
     out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to\line
     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such\line
     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or\line
     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\line
\line
13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\line
\line
     Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as\line
     "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial\line
     Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under\line
     Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified\line
     by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.\line

\line
\line
SPECIAL EXCEPTION FOR COMPRESSED EXECUTABLES\line
============================================\line
\line
   The stub which is imbedded in each UPX compressed program is part\line
   of UPX and UCL, and contains code that is under our copyright. The\line
   terms of the GNU General Public License still apply as compressing\line
   a program is a special form of linking with our stub.\line
\line
   Hereby Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer and Laszlo Molnar grant you special\line
   permission to freely use and distribute all UPX compressed programs\line
   (including commercial ones), subject to the following restrictions:\line
\line
   1. You must compress your program with a completely unmodified UPX\line
      version; either with our precompiled version, or (at your option)\line
      with a self compiled version of the unmodified UPX sources as\line
      distributed by us.\line
   2. This also implies that the UPX stub must be completely unmodfied, i.e.\line
      the stub imbedded in your compressed program must be byte-identical\line
      to the stub that is produced by the official unmodified UPX version.\line
   3. The decompressor and any other code from the stub must exclusively get\line
      used by the unmodified UPX stub for decompressing your program at\line
      program startup. No portion of the stub may get read, copied,\line
      called or otherwise get used or accessed by your program.\line
\line
\line
ANNOTATIONS\line
===========\line
\line
  - You can use a modified UPX version or modified UPX stub only for\line
    programs that are compatible with the GNU General Public License.\line
\line
  - We grant you special permission to freely use and distribute all UPX\line
    compressed programs. But any modification of the UPX stub (such as,\line
    but not limited to, removing our copyright string or making your\line
    program non-decompressible) will immediately revoke your right to\line
    use and distribute a UPX compressed program.\line
\line
  - UPX is not a software protection tool; by requiring that you use\line
    the unmodified UPX version for your proprietary programs we\line
    make sure that any user can decompress your program. This protects\line
    both you and your users as nobody can hide malicious code -\line
    any program that cannot be decompressed is highly suspicious\line
    by definition.\line
\line
  - You can integrate all or part of UPX and UCL into projects that\line
    are compatible with the GNU GPL, but obviously you cannot grant\line
    any special exceptions beyond the GPL for our code in your project.\line
\line
  - We want to actively support manufacturers of virus scanners and\line
    similar security software. Please contact us if you would like to\line
    incorporate parts of UPX or UCL into such a product.\line

or selling:\line
\line
1. Definitions.\line
\line
    (a) "Original Software" means source code of computer software code which\line
    is described in Exhibit A as Original Software.\line
\line
    (b) "Modifications" means any addition to or deletion from the substance\line
    or structure of either the Original Software or any previous\line
    Modifications. When Subject Software is released as a series of files, a\line
    Modification means (i) any addition to or deletion from the contents of a\line

2. Redistribution of Source Code Subject to These Terms. Redistributions of\line
Subject Software in source code form must retain the notice set forth in\line
Exhibit A, below, in every file. A copy of this License must be included in\line
any documentation for such Subject Software where the recipients' rights\line
relating to Subject Software are described. Recipient may distribute the\line
source code version of Subject Software under a license of Recipient's choice,\line
which may contain terms different from this License, provided that (i)\line
Recipient is in compliance with the terms of this License, and (ii) the\line
license terms include this Section 2 and Sections 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 12 and 13 of\line
this License, which terms may not be modified or superseded by any other terms\line
of such license. If Recipient distributes the source code version under a\line
different license Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any terms which\line
differ from this License are offered by Recipient alone, not by SGI. Recipient\line
hereby agrees to indemnify SGI for any liability incurred by SGI as a result\line
of any such terms Recipient offers.\line
\line
3. Redistribution in Executable Form. The notice set forth in Exhibit A must\line
be conspicuously included in any notice in an executable version of Subject\line
Software, related documentation or collateral in which Recipient describes the\line
user's rights relating to the Subject Software. Recipient may distribute the\line
executable version of Subject Software under a license of Recipient's choice,\line
which may contain terms different from this License, provided that (i)\line
Recipient is in compliance with the terms of this License, and (ii) the\line
license terms include this Section 3 and Sections 4, 7, 8, 10, 12 and 13 of\line
this License, which terms may not be modified or superseded by any other terms\line

hereby agrees to indemnify SGI for any liability incurred by SGI as a result\line
of any such terms Recipient offers.\line
\line
4. Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\line
automatically if Recipient fails to comply with terms herein and fails to cure\line
such breach within 30 days of the breach. Any sublicense to the Subject\line
Software which is properly granted shall survive any termination of this\line
License absent termination by the terms of such sublicense. Provisions which,\line
by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License\line
shall survive.\line
\line
5. No Trademark Rights. This License does not grant any rights to use any\line
trade name, trademark or service mark whatsoever. No trade name, trademark or\line
service mark of SGI may be used to endorse or promote products derived from\line
the Subject Software without prior written permission of SGI.\line
\line
6. No Other Rights. This License does not grant any rights with respect to the\line
OpenGL API or to any software or hardware implementation thereof or to any\line
other software whatsoever, nor shall any other rights or licenses not\line
expressly granted hereunder arise by implication, estoppel or otherwise with\line
respect to the Subject Software. Title to and ownership of the Original\line
Software at all times remains with SGI. All rights in the Original Software\line
not expressly granted under this License are reserved.\line
\line
7. Compliance with Laws; Non-Infringement. Recipient shall comply with all\line
applicable laws and regulations in connection with use and distribution of the\line
Subject Software, including but not limited to, all export and import control\line
laws and regulations of the U.S. government and other countries. Recipient may\line
not distribute Subject Software that (i) in any way infringes (directly or\line
contributorily) the rights (including patent, copyright, trade secret,\line
trademark or other intellectual property rights of any kind) of any other\line
person or entity or (ii) breaches any representation or warranty, express,\line
implied or statutory, which under any applicable law it might be deemed to\line
have been distributed.\line
\line
8. Claims of Infringement. If Recipient at any time has knowledge of any one\line
or more third party claims that reproduction, modification, use, distribution,\line
import or sale of Subject Software (including particular functionality or code\line
incorporated in Subject Software) infringes the third party's intellectual\line
property rights, Recipient must place in a well-identified web page bearing\line
the title "LEGAL" a description of each such claim and a description of the\line
party making each such claim in sufficient detail that a user of the Subject\line
Software will know whom to contact regarding the claim. Also, upon gaining\line
such knowledge of any such claim, Recipient must conspicuously include the URL\line
for such web page in the Exhibit A notice required under Sections 2 and 3,\line
above, and in the text of any related documentation, license agreement or\line
collateral in which Recipient describes end user's rights relating to the\line
Subject Software. If Recipient obtains such knowledge after it makes Subject\line
Software available to any other person or entity, Recipient shall take other\line
steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably\line
calculated to inform those who received the Subject Software that new\line
knowledge has been obtained.\line
\line

WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT\line
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,\line
MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON- INFRINGING. SGI ASSUMES NO\line

PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, SGI ASSUMES NO COST OR LIABILITY FOR ANY\line
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN\line
ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED\line
HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\line
\line
10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY,\line
WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY),\line
CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL SGI OR ANY SGI LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY\line
DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY\line
CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK\line
STOPPAGE, LOSS OF DATA, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\line
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF\line
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY\line
TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SGI's NEGLIGENCE TO\line
THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT\line
ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO\line
THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO RECIPIENT.\line
\line
11. Indemnity. Recipient shall be solely responsible for damages arising,\line
directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License.\line
Recipient will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Silicon Graphics, Inc. from\line
and against any loss, liability, damages, costs or expenses (including the\line

acquire only the rights set forth in this License and are subject to the terms\line
of this License.\line
\line
13. Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning\line
subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\line
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed so as to achieve as nearly as\line
possible the same economic effect as the original provision and the remainder\line
of this License will remain in effect. This License shall be governed by and\line
construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and the State of\line
California as applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely\line
within California between California residents. Any litigation relating to\line
this License shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal\line
Courts of the Northern District of California (or, absent subject matter\line
jurisdiction in such courts, the courts of the State of California), with\line
venue lying exclusively in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing\line
party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and\line
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations\line
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly\line
excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract\line
shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\line

executable form. A copy of the License and the Required Notice must be\line
included in that file. Recipient may distribute Accompanying Technology under\line
a license of Recipient's choice, which may contain terms different from this\line
License, provided that (i) Recipient is in compliance with the terms of this\line
License, (ii) such other license terms do not modify or supersede the terms of\line
this License as applicable to the Subject Software, (iii) Recipient hereby\line

automatically if Recipient fails to comply with terms herein and fails to cure\line
such breach within 30 days of the breach. Any sublicense to the Subject\line
Software that is properly granted shall survive any termination of this\line
License absent termination by the terms of such sublicense. Provisions which,\line
by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License\line
shall survive.\line
\line
4. Trademark Rights. This License does not grant any rights to use any trade\line

contributorily) the rights (including patent, copyright, trade secret,\line
trademark or other intellectual property rights of any kind) of any other\line
person or entity, or (ii) breaches any representation or warranty, express,\line
implied or statutory, which under any applicable law it might be deemed to\line
have been distributed.\line
\line
7. Claims of Infringement. If Recipient at any time has knowledge of any one\line
or more third party claims that reproduction, modification, use, distribution,\line

property rights, Recipient must place in a well-identified web page bearing\line
the title "LEGAL" a description of each such claim and a description of the\line
party making each such claim in sufficient detail that a user of the Subject\line
Software will know whom to contact regarding the claim. Also, upon gaining\line
such knowledge of any such claim, Recipient must conspicuously include the URL\line
for such web page in the Required Notice, and in the text of any related\line
documentation, license agreement or collateral in which Recipient describes\line
end user's rights relating to the Subject Software. If Recipient obtains such\line
knowledge after it makes Subject Software available to any other person or\line
entity, Recipient shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate\line
mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to provide such knowledge\line
to those who received the Subject Software.\line
\line

provision and the remainder of this License will remain in effect. This\line
License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the\line
United States and the State of California as applied to agreements entered\line
into and to be performed entirely within California between California\line

County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including\line
without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses.\line

      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but\line
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,\line
      and conversions to other media types.\line
\line
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or\line
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a\line
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work\line
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\line
\line
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\line
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\line
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\line
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\line
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\line
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\line
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\line
\line
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including\line
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\line
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\line
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\line

      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\line
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\line

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\line
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\line
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\line
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\line
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\line
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\line
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\line
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\line
      as of the date such litigation is filed.\line
\line
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\line
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\line
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\line
      meet the following conditions:\line

          stating that You changed the files; and\line
\line
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\line
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\line
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\line
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\line
          the Derivative Works; and\line
\line
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\line
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\line
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\line
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\line
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\line
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\line
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\line
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\line
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\line
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\line
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\line
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\line
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\line
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\line
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\line
          as modifying the License.\line
\line
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\line
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\line
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\line
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\line
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\line
      the conditions stated in this License.\line
\line
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\line
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\line
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\line
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\line
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\line
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\line
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\line
\line
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\line
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\line
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\line
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\line
\line
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\line
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\line
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\line
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\line
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\line
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\line
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\line
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\line
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\line
\line
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\line
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\line
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\line
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\line
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\line
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\line
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\line
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\line
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\line
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\line
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\line
\line
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\line
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\line
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\line
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\line
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\line
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\line
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\line
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\line
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\line
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\line

  The contents of this file are subject to the restrictions and limitations\line
  set forth in the SYNOPSYS Open Source License Version 1.0  (the "License"); \line
  you may not use this file except in compliance with such restrictions \line
  and limitations. You may obtain instructions on how to receive a copy of \line
  the License at\line
  http://www.synopsys.com/partners/tapin/tapinprogram.html. \line
  Software distributed by Original Contributor under the License is \line
  distributed on an "AS IS" basis, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, either \line
  expressed or implied. See the License for the specific language governing \line
  rights and limitations under the License.\line
\line
SYNOPSYS Open Source\line
SDC License Agreement\line
\line
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS SYNOPSYS OPEN SOURCE LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\line
\line
1. DEFINITIONS \line
"Contribution" means: \line
\line
a) in the case of Synopsys, Inc., ("Synopsys"), the Original Program, and\line
b) in the case of each Contributor,\line
i) changes to the Program, and\line
ii) additions to the Program;\line
\line
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was made by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\line
\line
"Contributor" means Synopsys and any other entity that distributes the Program.\line
\line
"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor that are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program. A Licensed Patent only includes claims directed towards a data structure, algorithm, technique or method that is directly implemented by the Contribution alone or by the Contribution combined with the Program existing at the time the Contribution is made.\line
\line
"Original Program" means the original version of the SDC format specification and reference implementation accompanying this Agreement as released by Synopsys, including source code, object code and documentation, if any.\line
\line
"Program" means the Original Program and other Contributions.\line
\line
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.\line
\line
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS \line
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\line
\line
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under that Contributor's Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The scope of a Contributor's Licensed Patents shall be limited solely to the extent of that Contributor's Contribution. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations that include the Contribution.\line
\line
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\line
\line
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\line
\line
3. REQUIREMENTS \line
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\line
\line
a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\line
\line
b) its license agreement:\line
\line
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\line
\line
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\line
\line
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\line
\line
iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\line
\line
When the Program is made available in source code form:\line
\line
a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\line
\line
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\line
\line
Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:\line
\line
Copyright © \{date here\}, Synopsys, Inc. and others. All Rights reserved.\line
\line
In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\line
\line
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION \line
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. \line
\line
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\line
\line
5. NO WARRANTY \line
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\line
\line
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY \line
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\line
\line
7. GENERAL \line
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\line
\line
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\line
\line
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\line
\line
Synopsys may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than Synopsys has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\line
\line
This Agreement is governed by the laws of California, without reference to conflict of laws principles. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.\line

research!dmg / strtod for IEEE-, VAX-, and IBM-arithmetic machines. This strtod\line
returns a nearest machine number to the input decimal string (or sets errno to\line
ERANGE). With IEEE arithmetic, ties are broken by the IEEE round-even rule.\line
Otherwise ties are broken by biased rounding (add half and chop). Inspired\line
loosely by William D. Clinger's paper "How to Read Floating Point Numbers\line
Accurately" [Proc. ACM SIGPLAN '90, pp. 92-101]. Modifications: 1. We only\line
require IEEE, IBM, or VAX double-precision arithmetic (not IEEE double-\line
extended). 2. We get by with floating-point arithmetic in a case that Clinger\line
missed -- when we're computing d 10^n for a small integer d and the integer n is\line
not too much larger than 22 (the maximum integer k for which we can represent\line
10^k exactly), we may be able to compute (d10^k) 10^(e-k) with just one\line
roundoff. 3. Rather than a bit-at-a-time adjustment of the binary result in the\line
hard case, we use floating-point arithmetic to determine the adjustment to\line
within one bit; only in really hard cases do we need to compute a second\line
residual. 4. Because of 3., we don't need a large table of powers of 10 for ten-\line
to-e (just some small tables, e.g. of 10^k for 0 < k < 22). / define IEEE_8087\line
for IEEE-arithmetic machines where the least significant byte has the lowest\line
address. define IEEE_MC68k for IEEE-arithmetic machines where the most\line
significant byte has the lowest address. define Sudden_Underflow for IEEE-format\line
machines without gradual underflow (i.e., that flush to zero on underflow).\line
define IBM for IBM mainframe-style floating-point arithmetic. define VAX for\line
VAX-style floating-point arithmetic. define Unsigned_Shifts if >> does treats\line
its left operand as unsigned. define No_leftCopyrightto omit left-Copyrightlogic in\line
fast floating-point computation of dtoa. define Check_FLT_ROUNDS if FLT_ROUNDS\line
can assume the values 2 or 3. define RND_PRODQUOT to use rnd_prod and rnd_quot\line
(assembly routines that use extended-precision instructions to compute rounded\line
products and quotients) with IBM. define ROUND_BIASED for IEEE-format with\line
biased rounding. define Inaccurate_Divide for IEEE-format with correctly rounded\line
products but inaccurate quotients, e.g., for Intel i860. define Just_16 to store\line
16 bits per 32-bit long when doing high-precision integer arithmetic. Whether\line
this speeds things up or slows things down depends on the machine and the number\line
being converted. /\line

   otherwise with any persons permitted access to the Programs, so as to\line
   enable Licensee to satisfy its obligations under the terms of this\line
   Agreement.\line
\line
7. LICENSES FOR THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS.  MathWorks has been\line
   granted licenses to distribute certain Third Party software either as\line
   part of a Program or, in the case of the PolySpace(TM) Products, as\line
   separate products licensed under a separate license agreement.  These\line
   licenses require MathWorks to distribute the software, or the PolySpace\line
   Products, as the case may be, to Licensee subject to specific terms and\line
   conditions, which may be different from or additional to those contained\line
   herein.  Should such Third Party software be provided under the Lesser\line
   General Public License, Licensee may make modifications of the work\line
   identified in Section 6 of the Lesser General Public License for\line
   Licensee's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such\line
   modifications.  Licensee agrees that acceptance of this Agreement also\line
   confirms Licensee's acceptance of any applicable Third Party software\line
   licenses.  Such Third Party licenses may be viewed at\line
   www.mathworks.com/thirdpartylicense.  Licensee may also contact\line
   MathWorks to obtain the current applicable provisions.  \line
\line
8. SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE SERVICE. During any paid Software Maintenance\line
   Service term, if applicable, MathWorks shall provide Software\line
   Maintenance Service for the licensed Programs which consists of:\line
   delivering subsequent releases of the Programs, if any, that are not\line
   charged for separately; exerting reasonable efforts to both (a) provide,\line
   within a reasonable time, workarounds for any material programming\line
   errors in the current release of the Programs that are directly\line
   attributable to MathWorks, and (b) correct such errors in the next\line
   available release, provided Licensee provides MathWorks with sufficient\line
   information to identify the errors.  During this same paid Software\line
   Maintenance Service term, Licensee shall also be entitled to receive\line
   technical support for the current release.  Technical support means\line
   assistance by telephone and electronic mail with the installation and/or\line
   use of the then-current release of the licensed Programs, including all\line
   available bug fixes and patches, and their interaction with supported\line
   hardware and operating systems ("Platforms").  MathWorks reserves the\line
   option to discontinue, in whole or in part, and at any time, offering\line
   Software Maintenance Service and/or technical support for any Program or\line
   Platform.\line
\line
9. LICENSE DURATION ("TERM").  This Agreement shall continue until the\line
   earlier of (a) termination by MathWorks or Licensee as provided below,\line
   or (b) such time as there are no Programs being licensed to Licensee\line
   hereunder.  \line
\line
  9.1. For Annual Licenses:  Licensee understands and agrees that each\line
       Annual License will expire automatically immediately after its\line
       corresponding one (1) year period, unless Licensee renews its\line
       License by remitting the then-current annual License fee.  Licensee\line
       understands that the Programs will stop operating unless Licensee\line
       pays the License fee and is provided new annual passcodes.\line
       Licensee understands and agrees that the Software Maintenance\line
       Service for each Annual License will terminate automatically upon\line
       expiration of the Annual License Term. \line
\line
  9.2. For Term Licenses:  Licensee understands and agrees that each Term\line
       License will expire automatically immediately after the\line
       corresponding period of the term licensed, unless Licensee renews\line
       its License by remitting the then-current term License Fee.\line
       Licensee understands that the Programs will stop operating unless\line
       Licensee pays the license fee and is provided new term passcodes.\line
       Licensee understands and agrees that the Software Maintenance\line
       Service for each Term License will terminate automatically upon\line
       expiration of the License Term. \line
\line
  9.3. For Perpetual Licenses:  Licensee shall have the right to use the\line
       Programs indefinitely, subject to the termination provisions in this\line
       Agreement.  Licensee understands and agrees that the Software\line
       Maintenance Service for each Perpetual License will terminate\line
       automatically upon expiration of the initial Software Maintenance\line
       Service term included with the acquisition of the License.\line
       Thereafter, the Software Maintenance Service term may be renewed for\line
       any Program, at the then-current price, and for the then-applicable\line
       term, as long as MathWorks offers such Software Maintenance Service\line
       for such Program.\line
\line
  9.4. For Student Licenses:  See the Student Version Installation and Use\line
       Addendum for the License Term. \line
\line
10. TERMINATION.  MathWorks may terminate this Agreement and all Licenses\line
    granted hereunder by written notice to Licensee if Licensee breaches\line
    any material term of this License, including failure to pay any License\line
    fees due, and Licensee has not cured such breach within sixty (60) days\line
    of written notification.  MathWorks may immediately terminate upon\line
    notice this Agreement and all Licenses granted hereunder should\line
    Licensee breach the terms and conditions of Articles 3, 4, and/or 11.\line
    Licensee may terminate this License at any time, for any reason.\line
    Licensee shall not be entitled to any refund if this License is\line
    terminated, except for License fees paid for any Programs for which the\line
    Acceptance Period has not expired at the time of termination.  Upon\line
    termination, Licensee shall promptly return all but archival copies of\line
    the Programs in Licensee's possession or control, or promptly provide\line
    written certification of their destruction.\line
\line
11. EXPORT CONTROL.  The Programs may be subject to U.S. export control\line
    laws or other (U.S. and non-U.S.) governmental export and import laws\line
    and regulations.  Notwithstanding any other term of this Agreement or\line
    Third Party agreement, Licensee's rights under this Agreement may not\line
    be exercised by Licensee or any Third Party in violation of such laws\line
    and regulations, nor may this Agreement be transferred to any party\line
    where doing so would result in such a violation.  The terms of any\line
    limitation on the use, transfer or re-export of the Programs imposed by\line
    MathWorks in any Destination Control Statement or other document for\line
    the purpose of export control shall prevail over any term in this\line
    Agreement.  It shall be Licensee's responsibility to comply with the\line
    latest United States or other governmental export and import\line
    regulations.\line
\line
12. FEDERAL ACQUISITION.  This provision applies to all acquisitions of the\line
    Programs and Documentation by, for, or through the federal government\line
    of the United States.  By accepting delivery of the Programs or\line
    Documentation, the government hereby agrees that this software or\line
    documentation qualifies as commercial computer software or commercial\line
    computer software documentation as such terms are used or defined in\line
    FAR 12.212, DFARS Part 227.72, and DFARS 252.227-7014.  Accordingly,\line
    the terms and conditions of this Agreement and only those rights\line
    specified in this Agreement, shall pertain to and govern the use,\line
    modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, and\line
    disclosure of the Programs and Documentation by the federal government\line
    (or other entity acquiring for or through the federal government) and\line
    shall supersede any conflicting contractual terms or conditions.  If\line
    this License fails to meet the government's needs or is inconsistent in\line
    any respect with federal procurement law, the government agrees to\line
    return the Programs and Documentation, unused, to MathWorks. \line
\line
13. FOR EUROPEAN UNION LICENSEES ONLY.  Any contractual provisions of this\line
    Agreement contrary to laws implemented under Article 6 of Appendix V of\line
    the European Union Software Directive or to the exceptions provided for\line
    in Article 5(2) and (3) of such Appendix shall be null and void solely\line
    to the extent decompiling, disassembling, or otherwise\line
    reverse-engineering of the Programs is necessary to enable the Licensee\line
    to create an independent program that is interoperable with the\line
    Programs or any other permitted objectives specified by such laws\line
    implemented under such directive (collectively, the "Permitted\line
    Objectives"), provided that any such information gained is used solely\line
    for such Permitted Objectives. \line
\line
14. TAXES, DUTIES, CUSTOMS.  Absent appropriate exemption certificates or\line
    other conclusive proof of tax exempt status, Licensee shall pay all\line
    applicable sales, use, excise, value-added, and other taxes, duties,\line
    levies, assessments, and governmental charges payable in connection\line
    with this Agreement or the Licenses granted hereunder, excluding taxes\line
    based on or measured by MathWorks' income, for which MathWorks shall be\line
    solely responsible. \line
\line
15. ASSIGNMENT.  Licensee may not assign or otherwise transfer this\line
    Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder, in whole or in\line
    part, by operation of law or otherwise, without the written consent of\line
    MathWorks.  In the case of any permitted assignment or transfer of or\line
    under this Agreement, this Agreement or the relevant provisions shall\line
    be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the successors,\line
    executors, heirs, representatives, administrators and assigns of the\line
    parties hereto.  MathWorks may charge Licensee an administrative fee\line
    for any permitted assignment.\line
\line
16. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  The Programs should not be relied on as the\line
    sole basis to solve a problem or implement a design whose incorrect\line
    solution or implementation could result in injury to person or\line
    property.  If a Program is employed in such a manner, it is at the\line
    Licensee's own risk and MathWorks and its Licensors explicitly disclaim\line
    all liability for such misuse to the extent allowed by law.  MathWorks'\line
    and MathWorks' Licensors' liability for death or personal injury\line
    resulting from negligence or for any other matter in relation to which\line
    liability by law cannot be excluded or limited shall not be excluded or\line
    limited.  Except as aforesaid, (a) any other liability of MathWorks and\line
    its Licensors (whether in relation to breach of contract, negligence or\line
    otherwise) shall not in total exceed the amount paid to MathWorks under\line
    this Agreement in the twelve month period preceding the claim in\line
    question, for the Program with respect to which the liability in\line
    question arises; and (b) MathWorks and its Licensors shall have no\line
    liability for any indirect or consequential loss (whether foreseeable\line
    or otherwise and including loss of profits, loss of business, loss of\line
    opportunity, and loss of use of any computer hardware or software).\line
    Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or\line
    consequential damages, so the above exclusion or limitation may not\line
    apply to Licensee. \line
\line
17. LIMITED WARRANTY/LIMITATION OF REMEDIES.  MathWorks warrants that\line
    MathWorks, on its own behalf or through its Licensors, has the right to\line
    grant the License rights hereunder.  MathWorks warrants that the\line
    physical media provided shall be free from defects in material and\line
    workmanship for a period of ninety (90) days from delivery, or it will\line
    be replaced by MathWorks at no cost to Licensee.  MathWorks further\line
    warrants, for a period of one (1) year from delivery or for the term of\line
    the License, whichever is less, that each copy of each Program will\line
    conform in all material respects to the description of such Program's\line
    operation in the Documentation.  In the event that a Program does not\line
    operate as warranted, Licensee's exclusive remedy and MathWorks' sole\line
    liability under this warranty shall be the correction or workaround by\line
    MathWorks of major defects within a reasonable time.  Should such\line
    correction or workaround be impractical, MathWorks may, at its option,\line
    terminate the relevant License and refund the initial License fee paid\line
    to MathWorks for such Program.  All requests for warranty assistance\line
    should be directed to The MathWorks, Inc., 3 Apple Hill Drive, Natick,\line
    MA 01760-2098, U.S.A.\line
\line
18. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.  Except for warranties expressly set forth in\line
    Article 17 of this Agreement (or as implied by law where the law\line
    provides that the particular terms implied cannot be excluded by\line
    contract), any and all Programs, Documentation, and Software\line
    Maintenance Services are delivered "as is" and MathWorks makes and the\line
    Licensee receives no additional express or implied warranties.\line
    MathWorks and its Licensors hereby expressly disclaim any and all other\line
    conditions, warranties, or other terms of any kind or nature concerning\line
    the Programs, Documentation, and Software Maintenance Services\line
    (including, without limitation, any with regard to infringement,\line
    merchantability, quality, accuracy, or fitness for a particular purpose\line
    or Licensee's purpose).  MathWorks also expressly disclaims any\line
    warranties that may be implied from usage of trade, course of dealing,\line
    or course of performance.  Except for the express warranties stated in\line
    Article 17 of this Agreement, the Programs, Documentation, and Software\line
    Maintenance Services are provided with all faults, and the entire risk\line
    of satisfactory quality, performance, accuracy, and effort is with\line
    Licensee.  MathWorks does not warrant that the Programs and\line
    Documentation will operate without interruption or be error free.  Some\line
    states and countries do not allow limitations on how long an implied\line
    warranty lasts, so the above limitation may not apply to Licensee.  The\line
    warranty in Article 17 gives Licensee specific legal rights and\line
    Licensee may also have other rights which vary from state to state and\line
    country to country.  Licensee accepts responsibility for its use of the\line
    Programs and the results obtained therefrom.\line
\line
19. GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION.  This Agreement shall be interpreted,\line
    enforced and construed and the rights of the parties hereunder governed\line
    in all respects by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,\line
    United States of America, without regard to its conflicts of law\line
    provisions, and both parties consent to the jurisdiction of the federal\line
    and state courts located in said Commonwealth and consent to the\line
    service of process, pleadings and notices in connection with any and\line
    all actions initiated in such courts.  The parties agree that a final\line
    judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and\line
    binding and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction.  To the extent\line
    any governing law, treaty, or regulation is in conflict with this\line
    Agreement, the conflicting terms of this Agreement shall be superseded\line
    only to the extent necessary by such law, treaty, or regulation.  If\line
    any provision of this Agreement shall be otherwise unlawful, void, or\line
    otherwise unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the\line
    maximum extent permissible.  In either case, the remainder of this\line
    Agreement shall not be affected.  The parties agree that the U.N.\line
    Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not\line
    apply to this Agreement.  The parties further agree that the Uniform\line
    Computer Information Transactions Act, or any version thereof, adopted\line
    by any state, in any form ("UCITA"), shall not apply to this Agreement.\line
    To the extent that UCITA is applicable, the parties agree to opt out of\line
    the applicability of UCITA pursuant to the Opt-Out provision(s)\line
    contained therein. \line
\line
20. COMPLIANCE AND AUDIT RIGHTS.  Licensee agrees to notify MathWorks\line
    promptly upon discovery of any failure to comply with one or more\line
    Licenses granted under this Agreement, or any failure to comply with\line
    any other material term of this Agreement.  To confirm Licensee's\line
    compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensee\line
    agrees to allow MathWorks to audit Licensee's use of the Programs, and\line
    to provide MathWorks access to Licensee's facilities and Computers, and\line
    cooperation from Licensee's employees and consultants, as reasonably\line
    requested by MathWorks in order to perform such audit, all during\line
    normal business hours, and after reasonable prior notice from\line
    MathWorks.  If an audit discloses that Licensee has failed to comply\line
    with one or more Licenses, and such failure to comply could have in\line
    part or in whole been avoided by Licensee having paid additional\line
    License fees to expand the scope of the License or Licenses, then\line
    Licensee shall promptly pay MathWorks such Licensing fees (at\line
    MathWorks' then current rates) and, if such unpaid License fees exceed\line
    5% of the License fees paid to MathWorks for the applicable Programs\line
    during the applicable period during which such underpayment occurred,\line
    then Licensee shall, in addition to paying the unpaid License fees,\line
    also reimburse MathWorks the full cost of such audit.\line
\line
21. LICENSE MANAGEMENT.  The Programs contain technology for the prevention\line
    of unlicensed use.  The Programs require activation to exercise your\line
    rights under this Agreement.  You may also need to activate if you\line
    redesignate the Programs on your License or modify your computer\line
    hardware.\line
\line
    Activation associates the use of the Programs with a specific Computer, and\line
    in some cases the Licensed User.  During activation, data about the\line
    Programs and the Computer will be transmitted to MathWorks.  This data\line
    includes the License information, Computer identification, and location.\line
    Some License Options may require the MathWorks Account information and the\line
    operating system user name for the Licensed User.  A License file will be\line
    provided to complete activation.  \line
\line
22. HEADINGS.  The inclusion of headings is for convenience of reference\line
    only and shall not affect the construction or interpretation of this\line
    Agreement.\line
\line
23. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This Agreement, and any applicable Addendum thereto\line
    including any documents referenced therein are incorporated herein by\line
    reference, and contain the entire understanding of the parties and may\line
    not be modified or amended except by written instrument, executed by\line
    authorized representatives of MathWorks and Licensee.  In the event of\line
    any conflict between this Agreement and any purchase order executed by\line
    Licensee (whether executed before or after this Agreement), this\line
    Agreement shall prevail.\line

           per year, provided the number of Named Users in the file never\line
           exceeds the number licensed per Program.  Portions of the\line
           Programs may be installed on individual Computers to accelerate\line
           startup times, as long as the installations on the individual\line
           Computers are controlled by the License Manager on the network\line
           server.  A Named User may not use a Program on more than two (2)\line
           Computers simultaneously.\line
\line
    3.2.4. Network Concurrent User.  The Programs may only be\line
           installed in a central location on a single designated network\line

       the Program.  An Application must contain original code developed by\line
       Licensee and must provide substantial functionality not contained\line
       in, or provided by, the Program Components that are incorporated\line
       into such Application.  If a software file created by a Licensee\line
       incorporates Program Components, but does not meet the requirements\line
       of the previous sentence, then it is a Derivative Form (as defined\line
       below).  An Application may contain Linked Object Code which, if\line
       such Object Code was not Linked to the Application and was a\line
       standalone file, would otherwise have been deemed a Derivative Form. \line
\line
  4.2. Application License.  A license granted by Licensee to its end-users\line
       for the installation and use of Licensee's Application.\line
\line
  4.3. Generated Forms.  The output of the MATLAB(R) Compiler(TM),\line
       Real-Time Workshop(R), Stateflow(R) Coder(TM), Simulink(R) HDL\line
       Coder(TM), Embedded Coders, and other MathWorks' code generation\line
       Programs in the form of Source Code, as well as such Source Code\line
       converted to Object Code or Linked forms.\line
\line
  4.4. Derivative Forms.  A  software file that Licensee has derived from\line
       one or more Program Components (including without limitation by\line
       incorporating, translating, or modifying, in whole or in part, any\line
       Program Component), and which, if modified or copied without\line
       MathWorks' authorization, would constitute a copyright infringement\line
       or breach of the Agreement.  A software file created by Licensee\line
       which qualifies as an "Application" under the above definition shall\line
       not be deemed a Derivative Form.\line
\line
  4.5. Linked.   An executable or loadable file created by a compiler or\line
       linker program combining Object Code module files.\line
\line
  4.6. MAT-file.  The file format in which MATLAB stores data.\line
\line
  4.7. MCR Libraries.  MATLAB Compiler Runtime support libraries and other\line
       files for deployment of Applications created with the MATLAB\line
       Compiler.\line
\line
  4.8. Object Code.  The code created by a system compiler from source\line
       code; also called "machine-readable code".  Object Code can be\line
       Linked with an appropriate linker to resolve address references and\line
       may be combined with other Object Code for targeted execution on a\line
       specific processor.  Object Code includes "Object Code libraries"\line
       and "shared libraries," which are groupings of Object Code for\line
       specific purposes.\line
\line
  4.9. Program Component.  Any portion of, or file provided with, a\line
       Program.\line
\line
  4.10. Source Code.  Human-readable program code written in a higher-level\line
        language such as C, C++, Java(TM), MATLAB(R), MDL, VHDL(R),\line
        Verilog(R), or Fortran, which must be translated or compiled into\line
        machine-readable language before it can be executed by a Computer.\line
        Source Code also includes header files and other human-readable\line
        files necessary for a Program to be compiled in the higher-level\line
        language.\line
\line
  4.11. Standalone Application.  An Application created using programming\line
        languages and tools other than the Programs, which executes outside\line
        of the Programs.\line
\line
  4.12. Deployment Program.  Any MathWorks Program that either (a)\line
        generates Object Code or Source Code in response to user input, or\line
        (b) contains executable functions or data accessed by an\line
        Application (such as a DLL file).\line
\line
5. DEPLOYMENT PROGRAMS.  Licensed Users of MathWorks' Deployment Programs\line
   may automatically generate code from M-files, Simulink(R)/Stateflow(R)\line
   diagrams, and other representations, into Generated Forms.  Furthermore,\line
   Licensee may copy and deploy these Generated Forms for use outside of\line
   the Programs.\line
\line
   Not all Programs are eligible for deployment within Licensee's\line
   Application.  For a list of Ineligible Programs see\line
   www.mathworks.com/ineligible_programs. \line
\line
  5.1. MATLAB(R) Application Deployment Programs\line
\line
    5.1.1. MATLAB(R) Compiler(TM). Licensee may use and distribute the MCR\line
           Libraries for the sole purpose of running Licensed User's\line
           Application generated by the MATLAB Compiler.  Licensee may\line
           deploy, at no cost, copies of such Applications that incorporate\line
           the MCR Libraries and compiled versions of M-files from the\line
           licensed Programs required for the Application.  No further fees\line
           shall be due to MathWorks for such deployment within such\line
           Applications, regardless of whether the Application is\line
           distributed solely for Licensee's Internal Operations or to\line
           Third Parties. \line
\line
           Licensee may make copies of the MCR Libraries accessible for\line
           deployment on an internal server provided such deployment is\line
           solely to its Licensed Users for use with an Application and for\line
           Licensee's Internal Operations only.  Licensee agrees to employ\line
           the same security measures to protect the MCR Libraries as it\line
           uses to safeguard Licensee's own proprietary intellectual\line
           property, but in no event  less than reasonable care.  No\line
           further fees shall be due to MathWorks for such server\line
           deployment.  \line
\line
           Licensee is prohibited from making copies of the MCR Libraries\line
           accessible to any Third Party separate from a Licensed User's\line
           Application.  \line
\line
      5.1.1.1. Licensed User may include, by compilation for deployment,\line
               only those select M-files from the licensed Programs\line
               required for the Application.  \line
\line
      5.1.1.2. In no event shall Licensee distribute any library header\line
               files.\line
\line
      5.1.1.3. Licensee's Application may not provide functionality or\line
               behavior similar to that of the MATLAB command line.  \line
\line
      5.1.1.4. Licensee's Application may not allow operation of the code\line
               generation capabilities of Programs.\line
\line
      5.1.1.5. Licensee's Application may not provide access to an entire\line
               Program or a substantial portion of a Program. \line
\line
      5.1.1.6. Licensee shall include the notice "MATLAB(R). (c) 1984 -\line
               [INSERT YEAR MATLAB VERSION PUBLISHED] The MathWorks, Inc."\line
               in the deployed Application's About Box, or similar visible\line
               location, and in the applicable documentation distributed\line
               with each copy of the Application.  \line
\line
      5.1.1.7. Licensee must state in the documentation or other materials\line
               distributed with the Application that Licensee's limited\line
               rights to the deployment are governed by a certain license\line
               agreement between Licensee and MathWorks. Licensee may not\line
               modify or remove any license agreement file (MathWorks or\line
               Third-Party) that is included with the MCR Libraries ("MCR\line
               Library License").  Licensee shall insure that any licensee\line
               of the Application must first accept the terms of such MCR\line
               Library License prior to installation of the Application.\line
\line
  5.2. Simulink(R) Application Deployment Programs \line
\line
    5.2.1. Deployment Programs.  MathWorks provides directories of C, C++,\line
           Assembly, linker command files, template makefiles, project\line
           files, and TLC source code files with Programs that implement\line
           the real-time framework, code generation instructions,\line
           libraries, and Application Programming Interface (API) for use\line
           with the code generated by the Simulink family of products,\line
           including Real-Time Workshop, Stateflow Coder, Simulink HDL\line
           Coder, Embedded Coders and other Programs.  Licensee may use,\line
           copy, and modify these files in source code form for different\line
           development targets provided that they are only copied for\line
           development use in connection with Real-Time Workshop, Embedded\line
           Coders, Stateflow Coder, or other code generation Programs.\line
\line
      5.2.1.1. Licensee may copy and deploy these files outside of the\line
               Programs in Linked Object Code form or Source Code form, if\line
               only used in combination with code generated by those\line
               Programs as part of a larger standalone Application. \line
\line
      5.2.1.2. No further fees shall be due to MathWorks for such\line
               deployment within Licensee's Application, regardless of\line
               whether the Application is deployed solely for Licensee's\line
               Internal Operations or to Third Parties.\line
\line
    5.2.2. Real-Time Windows Target.  Licensee may not incorporate\line
           Real-Time Windows Target into an Application for deployment\line
           without contracting with MathWorks for an OEM or VAR agreement. \line
\line
    5.2.3. xPC Target.  Licensee may develop Applications that incorporate\line
           Linked-in copies of xPC Target and those files required for the\line
           Application that have been compiled or otherwise obtained from\line
           Real-Time Workshop and/or Stateflow Coder on a single\line
           development PC, and download that Application to a target PC\line
           directly connected to the development PC by either Ethernet or\line
           serial connections.  When running on xPC TargetBox(R), the\line
           Application may also be used for standalone operation, without\line
           connection to the development PC.  \line
\line
      5.2.3.1 The right to distribute the Application beyond the target PC\line
              is contingent upon acquiring a License for the xPC Target\line
              Embedded Option.  No further fees shall be due to MathWorks\line
              for such deployment within Licensee's Application, regardless\line
              of whether the Application is deployed solely for Licensee's\line
              Internal Operations or to Third Parties. Additionally, the\line
              Embedded Option License allows for the deployment of API\line
              DLL's beyond the development PC.  No further fees shall be\line
              due to MathWorks for such deployment outside of an\line
              Application, regardless of whether the API DLL's are deployed\line
              solely for Licensee's Internal Operations or to Third\line
              Parties.  \line
\line
6. OTHER SOURCE CODE AND SHARED OBJECT CODE LIBRARIES. \line
\line
  6.1. Programs may include selected Source Code and shared Object Code\line
       library files that implement various documented application\line
       programming interface capabilities of the Programs for which the\line
       Source Code or shared library file is part. \line
\line
    6.1.1. Licensed User may use and modify the selected Source Code files\line
           solely for creation of Licensee's own Applications. Licensee may\line
           copy and distribute Object Code compiled from this Source Code,\line
           but only as either standalone Object Code file (regardless\line
           whether a Derivative Form) or Object Code Linked to the\line
           Application, and only for use with and deployment of Licensee's\line
           own Application. \line
\line
    6.1.2. Licensee may use, copy and distribute shared Object Code library\line
           files (regardless whether a Derivative Form) for deployment of\line
           Licensee's own Application, but only if a header file exists in\line
           the Program for the shared library file. Licensee may not copy\line
           or distribute header files themselves.\line
\line
    6.1.3. Licensee may not transfer Source Code, development rights, or\line
           development capabilities for any Source Code or Object Code to\line
           any Third Party.\line
\line
  6.2. MAT-files.  Licensed User may create and distribute Applications\line
       that read MAT-files using the MAT-file API, however, if such\line
       Applications are distributed to Third Parties, they must also\line
       implement MAT-file write capability.\line
\line
7. DERIVATIVE FORMS.  A Licensee shall only be permitted to distribute a\line
   Derivative Form to Third Parties (a) to the extent expressly permitted\line
   under Articles 5 or 6 of this Addendum, or (b) subject to the\line
   requirements of this Article 7.  A Licensee may only distribute a\line
   Derivative Form to a Third Party under this Article 7 if such Third\line
   Party is bound by a Software License Agreement with MathWorks that\line
   requires such Third Party to treat such Derivative Forms received from\line
   Licensee as such Third Party's own Derivative Form thereunder.  Licensee\line
   agrees that if such a Third Party provides Licensee with software that\line
   is a Derivative Form under the terms of such Third Party's Software\line
   License Agreement with MathWorks (or would otherwise be a Derivative\line
   Form under the terms of this Agreement), then Licensee shall treat such\line
   software as a Derivative Form hereunder as if Licensee has modified or\line
   generated the software itself.\line
\line
8. WEB APPLICATIONS.  Only Programs licensed under the Network Concurrent\line
   User or Designated Computer Activation Types may be called from within a\line
   web Standalone Application, provided the web Standalone Application does\line
   not provide access to the MATLAB command line, or any of the licensed\line
   Programs with code generation capabilities.  In addition, Licensed Users\line
   may not provide access to an entire Program or a substantial portion of\line
   a Program.  Such operation of a Standalone Application via a web\line
   interface may be provided to an unlimited number of web browser clients,\line
   at no cost, for Licensee's own use for its Internal Operations, and for\line
   use by Third Parties. \line
\line
9. APPLICATION LICENSING.  For any distribution of Applications containing\line
   Object Code or Generated Forms to:\line
\line
  9.1. Licensee's internal organization:  Licensee shall take appropriate\line
       action by instruction, agreement, or otherwise with any recipients\line
       of the Application, so as to enable Licensee to satisfy its\line
       obligations under the terms of this Addendum and the Agreement.\line
\line
  9.2. Third Parties:  Your Application shall be accompanied by an\line
       Application License whose terms and conditions are at least as\line
       restrictive as the Agreement, unless the Application is part of an\line
       embedded system that has no provision for licensing to its end\line
       users. \line
\line
    9.2.1. The Application license for Third Parties must explicitly\line
           exclude MathWorks and its Licensors from all liability for\line
           damages or any obligation to provide remedial actions.\line
    9.2.2. In no circumstance shall Licensee include a warranty for any\line
           form of a Program that is inconsistent with or additional to the\line
           warranty contained in the Agreement.  \line
    9.2.3. The additional translation, use, and deployment rights granted\line
           in this Addendum are nontransferable without MathWorks' consent\line
           and shall not be conveyed in Licensee's Application license. \line
    9.2.4. All copyright and proprietary notices for the Programs that\line
           appear in the original form delivered to Licensee shall be\line
           duplicated and included with Licensee's own copyright notices\line
           for the Application, wherever they appear.\line
    9.2.5. Licensee may not remove any copyright, trademark, logo,\line
           proprietary rights, disclaimer or warning notice included on or\line
           embedded in any part of the deployed Application.\line
\line
  9.3. Notwithstanding the termination of the Agreement, all valid\line
       Application licenses shall remain and continue in full force and\line
       effect, and, if the Agreement was not terminated due to:  (a)\line
       Licensee's failure to pay the applicable fees to MathWorks, (b)\line
       Licensee's violation of the License restrictions, or (c) violation\line
       of MathWorks' proprietary rights in the Programs; then Licensee may\line
       continue to use the Programs to support Applications that have been\line
       placed in use pursuant to an Application License prior to the\line
       effective date of termination.\line
\line
10. DISCLAIMER OF OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITY.\line
\line
  10.1. MathWorks shall have no support or warranty obligations, and\line
        disclaims all liability, for Applications developed or distributed\line
        by Licensee.\line

        failures.\line
\line
  10.3. Licensee will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless MathWorks and\line
        its Licensors, officers, directors, employees, agents and resellers\line
        from and against any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses\line
        (including reasonable fees of MathWorks' attorneys) arising out of\line
        any Third Party claim or demand based on or arising from, out of or\line
        in connection with (i) the creation, use, or distribution of any\line
        Applications or (ii) the use of the Programs by Licensee.\line
\line
11. GENERAL.  Licensee acknowledges and agrees that a breach of the\line
    obligations set forth in this Addendum shall be a material breach of\line
    the Agreement.\line

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION\line
\line
Version 3.1, 31 March 2009\line
\line
Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\line
\line
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this\line
license document, but changing it is not allowed.\line
\line
This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional\line
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version\line
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that\line
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\line
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\line
\line
When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\line
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\line
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\line
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\line
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\line
\line
0. Definitions.\line
\line
A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime\line
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\line
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\line
on the Runtime Library.\line
\line
"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\line
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\line
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\line
subsequent versions published by the FSF.\line
\line
"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,\line
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\line
the license of GCC.\line
\line
"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\line
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\line
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\line
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\line
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\line
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.\line
\line
The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in\line
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\line
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\line
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\line
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\line
understood as starting with the output of the generators or\line
preprocessors.\line
\line
A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or\line
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\line
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\line
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\line
Eligible Compilation Process.\line
\line
1. Grant of Additional Permission.\line
\line
You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\line
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\line
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\line
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\line
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\line
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\line
\line
2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\line
\line
The availability of this Exception does not imply any general\line
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\line
requirements of the license of GCC.\line

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION\line
\line
Version 3.1, 31 March 2009\line
\line
Copyright (C) 2009-2014 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\line
\line
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this\line
license document, but changing it is not allowed.\line
\line
This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional\line
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version\line
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that\line
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\line
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\line
\line
When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\line
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\line
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\line
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\line
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\line
\line
0. Definitions.\line
\line
A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime\line
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\line
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\line
on the Runtime Library.\line
\line
"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\line
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\line
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\line
subsequent versions published by the FSF.\line
\line
"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,\line
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\line
the license of GCC.\line
\line
"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\line
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\line
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\line
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\line
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\line
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.\line
\line
The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in\line
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\line
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\line
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\line
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\line
understood as starting with the output of the generators or\line
preprocessors.\line
\line
A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or\line
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\line
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\line
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\line
Eligible Compilation Process.\line
\line
1. Grant of Additional Permission.\line
\line
You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\line
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\line
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\line
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\line
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\line
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\line
\line
2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\line
\line
The availability of this Exception does not imply any general\line
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\line
requirements of the license of GCC.\line

MinGW-w64 licensing\line
*******************\line
\line
The copyright and license notices have been divided in two files:\line
The notices in COPYING.MinGW-w64.txt (this file) apply only to\line
MinGW-w64 itself. These don't apply to the binaries built with\line
MinGW-w64 unless you specifically tell MinGW-w64 to link against\line
these parts, for example, by enabling profiling code.\line
\line
In addition to the notices in this file, also the notices in\line
COPYING.MinGW-w64-runtime.txt apply to MinGW-w64. Some (possibly\line
all) notices in that file may apply also to the binaries built with\line
this version of MinGW-w64. The idea is that if you create binary\line
packages of your software with MinGW-w64, you can simply copy\line
COPYING.MinGW-w64-runtime.txt into your package to fulfill the\line
license requirements of the MinGW runtime.\line
\line
If you think that not all notices apply to your package and want to\line
remove some of them, note that, for example, the gdtoa files always\line
get linked in if you use any printf-like function. So usually it is\line
easiest and safest to just keep all the notices.\line

\line
DirectX and DDK headers are under GNU LGPLv2.1+ (see the file\line
COPYING.LGPLv2.1) and copyrighted by various people. Using these\line
headers doesn't make LGPLv2.1 apply to your code, because these\line
headers files contain only data structure definitions, short\line
macros, and short inline functions. Here is the relevant part\line
from LGPLv2.1 section 5 paragraph 4:\line
\line
    If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line
    structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small\line
    inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use\line
    of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it\line
    is legally a derivative work.\line

FIXME: Cephes math lib\line
Copyright (C) 1984-1998 Stephen L. Moshier\line
\line
It sounds vague, but as to be found at\line
<http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/12/msg00295.html>, it gives an\line
impression that the author could be willing to give an explicit\line
permission to distribute those files e.g. under a BSD style license. So\line
probably there is no problem here, although it could be good to get a\line
permission from the author and then add a license into the Cephes files\line
in MinGW runtime. At least on follow-up it is marked that debian sees the\line
version a-like BSD one. As MinGW.org (where those cephes parts are coming\line
from) distributes them now over 6 years, it should be fine.\line

**************************************************\line
\line
Parts of this software have been adapted from the libpng package.      \line
Although this library supports all features from the PNG specification (as MNG descends from it) it does not require the libpng package.      \line
It does require the zlib library and optionally the IJG jpeg library, and/or the "little-cms" library by Marti Maria (depending on the inclusion of support for JNG and Full-Color-Management respectively. \line
\line
This library's function is primarily to read and display MNG animations. It is not meant as a full-featured image-editing component! It does however offer creation and editing functionality at the chunk level.                                                 \line
\line
(future modifications may include some more support for creation and or editing)                                                       \line

RXTX License v 2.1 - LGPL v 2.1 + Linking Over Controlled Interface.\line
RXTX is a native interface to serial ports in java.\line

actually wrote it.  See individual source files for more information.\line

\line
An executable that contains no derivative of any portion of RXTX, but\line
is designed to work with RXTX by being dynamically linked with it,\line
is considered a "work that uses the Library" subject to the terms and\line
conditions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\line
\line
The following has been added to the RXTX License to remove\line
any confusion about linking to RXTX.   We want to allow in part what\line
section 5, paragraph 2 of the LGPL does not permit in the special\line
case of linking over a controlled interface.  The intent is to add a\line
Java Specification Request or standards body defined interface in the \line
future as another exception but one is not currently available.\line
\line
http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#LinkingOverControlledInterface\line
\line
As a special exception, the copyright holders of RXTX give you\line
permission to link RXTX with independent modules that communicate with\line
RXTX solely through the Sun Microsytems CommAPI interface version 2,\line
regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy\line
and distribute the resulting combined work under terms of your choice,\line
provided that every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a complete\line
copy of the source code of RXTX (the version of RXTX used to produce the\line
combined work), being distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General\line
Public License plus this exception.  An independent module is a\line
module which is not derived from or based on RXTX.\line
\line
Note that people who make modified versions of RXTX are not obligated\line
to grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is\line
their choice whether to do so.  The GNU Lesser General Public License\line
gives permission to release a modified version without this exception; this\line
exception also makes it possible to release a modified version which\line
carries forward this exception.\line

<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>\line
SYNOPSYS Open Source\line
SDC License Agreement\line
\line
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS SYNOPSYS OPEN SOURCE LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\line
\line
1. DEFINITIONS \line
"Contribution" means: \line
\line
a) in the case of Synopsys, Inc., ("Synopsys"), the Original Program, and\line
b) in the case of each Contributor,\line
i) changes to the Program, and\line
ii) additions to the Program;\line
\line
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was made by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\line
\line
"Contributor" means Synopsys and any other entity that distributes the Program.\line
\line
"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor that are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program. A Licensed Patent only includes claims directed towards a data structure, algorithm, technique or method that is directly implemented by the Contribution alone or by the Contribution combined with the Program existing at the time the Contribution is made.\line
\line
"Original Program" means the original version of the SDC format specification and reference implementation accompanying this Agreement as released by Synopsys, including source code, object code and documentation, if any.\line
\line
"Program" means the Original Program and other Contributions.\line
\line
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.\line
\line
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS \line
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\line
\line
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under that Contributor's Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The scope of a Contributor's Licensed Patents shall be limited solely to the extent of that Contributor's Contribution. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations that include the Contribution.\line
\line
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\line
\line
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\line
\line
3. REQUIREMENTS \line
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\line
\line
a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\line
\line
b) its license agreement:\line
\line
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\line
\line
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\line
\line
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\line
\line
iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\line
\line
When the Program is made available in source code form:\line
\line
a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\line
\line
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\line
\line
Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:\line
\line
Copyright © \{date here\}, Synopsys, Inc. and others. All Rights reserved.\line
\line
In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\line
\line
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION \line
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. \line
\line
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\line
\line
5. NO WARRANTY \line
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\line
\line
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY \line
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\line
\line
7. GENERAL \line
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\line
\line
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\line
\line
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\line
\line
Synopsys may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than Synopsys has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\line
\line
This Agreement is governed by the laws of California, without reference to conflict of laws principles. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.\line

Summary:\line
========\line
\line
This directory contains the source code for U-Boot, a boot loader for\line
Embedded boards based on PowerPC, ARM, MIPS and several other\line
processors, which can be installed in a boot ROM and used to\line
initialize and test the hardware or to download and run application\line
code.\line
\line
The development of U-Boot is closely related to Linux: some parts of\line
the source code originate in the Linux source tree, we have some\line
header files in common, and special provision has been made to\line
support booting of Linux images.\line
\line
Some attention has been paid to make this software easily\line
configurable and extendable. For instance, all monitor commands are\line
implemented with the same call interface, so that it's very easy to\line
add new commands. Also, instead of permanently adding rarely used\line
code (for instance hardware test utilities) to the monitor, you can\line
load and run it dynamically.\line
\line
Status:\line
=======\line
\line
In general, all boards for which a configuration option exists in the\line
Makefile have been tested to some extent and can be considered\line
"working". In fact, many of them are used in production systems.\line
\line
In case of problems see the CHANGELOG and CREDITS files to find out\line
who contributed the specific port. The MAINTAINERS file lists board\line
maintainers.\line
\line
Where to get help:\line
==================\line
\line
In case you have questions about, problems with or contributions for\line
U-Boot you should send a message to the U-Boot mailing list at\line
<u-boot@lists.denx.de>. There is also an archive of previous traffic\line
on the mailing list - please search the archive before asking FAQ's.\line
Please see http://lists.denx.de/pipermail/u-boot and\line
http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.boot-loaders.u-boot\line
\line
Where to get source code:\line
=========================\line
\line
The U-Boot source code is maintained in the git repository at\line
git://www.denx.de/git/u-boot.git ; you can browse it online at\line
http://www.denx.de/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=u-boot.git;a=summary\line
\line
The "snapshot" links on this page allow you to download tarballs of\line
any version you might be interested in. Official releases are also\line
available for FTP download from the ftp://ftp.denx.de/pub/u-boot/\line
directory.\line
\line
Pre-built (and tested) images are available from\line
ftp://ftp.denx.de/pub/u-boot/images/\line

\line
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical\line
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but\line
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,\line
      and conversions to other media types.\line
\line
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or\line
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a\line
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work\line
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\line
\line
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\line
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\line
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\line
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\line
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\line
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\line
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\line
\line
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including\line
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\line
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\line
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\line
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\line
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"\line

\line
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity\line
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and\line
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.\line
\line
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\line
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\line
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\line
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,\line
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the\line
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\line
\line
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\line
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\line

      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\line
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\line

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\line
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\line
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\line
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\line
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\line
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\line
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\line
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\line
      as of the date such litigation is filed.\line
\line
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\line
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\line
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\line
      meet the following conditions:\line
\line
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\line
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\line
\line
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\line
          stating that You changed the files; and\line
\line
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\line
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\line
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\line
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\line
          the Derivative Works; and\line
\line
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\line
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\line
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\line
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\line
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\line
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\line
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\line
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\line
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\line
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\line
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\line
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\line
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\line
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\line
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\line
          as modifying the License.\line
\line
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\line
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\line
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\line
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\line
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\line
      the conditions stated in this License.\line
\line
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\line
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\line
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\line
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\line
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\line
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\line
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\line
\line
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\line
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\line
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\line
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\line
\line
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\line
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\line
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\line
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\line
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\line
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\line
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\line
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\line
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\line
\line
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\line
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\line
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\line
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\line
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\line
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\line
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\line
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\line
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\line
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\line
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\line
\line
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\line
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\line
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\line
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\line
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\line
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\line
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\line
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\line
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\line
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\line

\line
3. Distribution Obligations\line
3.1. Application of License\line
The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2.\line
\line
The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\line
\line
3.2. Availability of Source Code\line
Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\line
\line
3.3. Description of Modifications\line
You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\line
3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\line
    (a) Third Party Claims\line
    If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained. \line
    (b) Contributor APIs\line
    If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file. \line
    (c) Representations\line
    Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4 (a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License. \line
\line
3.5. Required Notices\line
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\line
\line
3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions\line
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2.\line
\line
The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License.\line
\line
If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\line
\line
3.7. Larger Works\line
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\line
\line
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\line
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\line
\line

You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by CenterPoint. No one other than CenterPoint has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\line
\line
7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY\line
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\line
\line
8. TERMINATION\line
\line
8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\line
\line
8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:\line
    (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above. \line
    (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1 (b) and 2.2 (b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant. \line
\line
8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\line
\line
8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\line
\line
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY\line
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\line
\line
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS\line
The Covered Code is a "commercial item", as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation", as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\line
\line
11. MISCELLANEOUS\line
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This license shall be governed by the Laws of Austria. Disputes shall be settled by an Austrian Court. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\line
\line
12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS\line
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\line

Common Public License (CPL) -- V1.0\line
\line
03 May 2005\line
Updated 16 Apr 2009\line
\line
As of 25 Feb 2009, IBM has assigned the Agreement Steward role for the CPL to the Eclipse Foundation. Eclipse has designated the Eclipse Public License (EPL) as the follow-on version of the CPL.\line
\line
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\line
\line
1.	DEFINITIONS \line
\line
"Contribution" means:\line
\line
a. in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\line
b. in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\line
i. changes to the Program, and\line
ii. additions to the Program;\line
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\line
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\line
\line
"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.\line
\line
"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\line
\line
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.\line
\line
2.	GRANT OF RIGHTS \line
\line
a. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\line
\line
b. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\line
\line
c. Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\line
\line
d. Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\line
\line
3.	REQUIREMENTS \line
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\line
\line
a. it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\line
\line
b. its license agreement:\line
\line
i. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\line
\line
ii. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\line
\line
iii. states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\line
\line
iv. states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\line
\line
When the Program is made available in source code form:\line
\line
a. it must be made available under this Agreement; and\line
\line
b. a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\line
\line
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.\line
\line
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\line
\line
4.	COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION \line
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\line
\line
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. \line
\line
5.	NO WARRANTY \line
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\line
\line
6.	DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY \line
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\line
\line
GENERAL \line
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\line
\line
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\line
\line
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\line
\line
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\line
\line
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.\line

For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.\line
   3. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.\line
   4. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.\line
   5. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License.\line

   5.\line
\line
      For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:\line
         1. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.\line
         2. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights society or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).\line

\line
4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\line
\line
   1. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work.

If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause 4(c), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4(c), as requested.\line
   2. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this License, a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License, or a Creative Commons iCommons license that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 Japan). You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License or other license specified in the previous sentence with every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Derivative Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License.\line
   3. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.\line
\line

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\line
\line
6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\line
\line
7. Termination\line
\line
   1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.

   2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\line
\line

   2. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\line
   3. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\line
   4. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\line

\line
3. DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS.\line
\line
     3.1. Application of License.\line
     The Modifications which You create or to which You\line
contribute are governed by the terms of this License,\line
including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code\line
version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the\line
terms of this License or a future version of this License\line
released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of\line
this License with every copy of the Source Code You\line
distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any\line
Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable\line
version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.\line
However, You may include an additional document offering the\line
additional rights described in Section 3.5.\line
\line
     3.2. Availability of Source Code.\line
     Any Modification which You create or to which You\line
contribute must be made available in Source Code form under\line
the terms of this License via an accepted Electronic\line
Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an\line
Executable version available and to the Initial Developer;\line
and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,\line
must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after\line
the date it initially became available, or at least six (6)\line
months after a subsequent version of that particular\line
Modification has been made available to such recipients. You\line
are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version\line
remains available even if the Electronic Distribution\line
Mechanism is maintained by a third party. You are\line
responsible for notifying the Initial Developer of the\line
Modification and the location of the Source if a contact\line
means is provided. Cygnus will be acting as maintainer of\line
the Source and may provide an Electronic Distribution\line
mechanism for the Modification to be made available. You can\line
contact Cygnus to make the Modification available and to\line
notify the Initial Developer. (http://sourceware.cygnus.com/ecos)\line
\line
     3.3. Description of Modifications.\line
     You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute\line
to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create\line
that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must\line
include a prominent statement that the Modification is\line
derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided\line
by the Initial Developer and including the name of the\line
Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any\line
notice in an Executable version or related documentation in\line
which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered\line
Code.\line
\line
     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\line
\line
          (a) Third Party Claims.\line
          If You have knowledge that a party claims an\line
intellectual property right in particular functionality or\line
code (or its utilization under this License), you must\line
include a text file with the source code distribution titled\line
"LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the\line
claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom\line
to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your\line
Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You\line
shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make\line
available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as\line
notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)\line
reasonably calculated to inform those who received the\line
Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\line
\line
          (b) Contributor APIs.\line
          If Your Modification is an application programming\line
interface and You own or control patents which are\line
reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also\line
include this information in the LEGAL file.\line
\line
     3.5. Required Notices.\line
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file\line
of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation\line
for the Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights\line
relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more\line
Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to\line
the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in\line
a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you\line
must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant\line
directory file) where a user would be likely to look for\line
such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee\line
for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations\line
to one or more recipients of Covered Code.\line
     However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not\line
on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You\line
must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,\line
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You\line
alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\line
Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred\line
by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of\line
warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\line
\line
     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\line
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only\line
if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for\line
that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that\line
the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available\line
under the terms of this License, including a description of\line
how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section\line
3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice\line
in an Executable version, related documentation or\line
collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating\line
to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable\line
version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice,\line
which may contain terms different from this License,\line
provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this\line
License and that the license for the Executable version does\line
not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the\line
Source Code version from the rights set forth in this\line
License. If You distribute the Executable version under a\line
different license You must make it absolutely clear that any\line
terms which differ from this License are offered by You\line
alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You\line
hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every\line
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial\line
Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms\line
You offer.\line
     If you distribute executable versions containing\line
Covered Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in\line
the documentation and/or other materials provided with the\line
product.\line
\line
     3.7. Larger Works.\line
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code\line
with other code not governed by the terms of this License\line
and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such\line
a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License\line
are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\line
\line
4. INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION.\line
\line
     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the\line
terms of this License with respect to some or all of the\line
Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a)\line
comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent\line
possible; (b) cite the statute or regulation that prohibits\line
you from adhering to the license; and (c) describe the\line
limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\line
be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and\line
must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.\line
Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,\line
such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\line
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. You\line
must submit this LEGAL file to Cygnus for review, and You\line
will not be able use the covered code in any means until\line
permission is granted from Cygnus to allow for the inability\line
to comply due to statute or regulation.\line
\line
5. APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE.\line
\line
     This License applies to code to which the Initial\line
Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to\line
related Covered Code.\line
      Cygnus may include Covered Code in products without\line
such additional products becoming subject to the terms of\line
this License, and may license such additional products on\line
different terms from those contained in this License.\line
     Cygnus may license the Source Code of Cygnus's Branded\line
Code without Cygnus's Branded Code becoming subject to the\line
terms of this License, and may license Cygnus's Branded Code\line
on different terms from those contained in this License.\line
Contact Cygnus for details of alternate licensing terms\line
available.\line
\line
6. VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE.\line
\line
     6.1. New Versions.\line
     Cygnus may publish revised and/or new versions of the\line
License from time to time. Each version will be given a\line
distinguishing version number.\line
\line
     6.2. Effect of New Versions.\line
     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular\line
version of the License, You may always continue to use it\line
under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use\line
such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version\line
of the License published by Cygnus. No one other than Cygnus\line
has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code\line
beyond what is granted under this and subsequent Licenses.\line
\line
     6.3. Derivative Works.\line
     If you create or use a modified version of this License\line
(which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is\line
not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must\line
(a) rename Your license so that the phrases "ECOS", "eCos",\line
"Cygnus", "CPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not\line
appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it\line
clear that your version of the license contains terms which\line
differ from the eCos Public License and Cygnus Public\line
License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,\line
Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in\line
Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be\line
modifications of this License.)\line
\line
7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\line
\line
     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS\line
IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\line
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT\line
THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A\line
PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO\line
THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU.\line
SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU\line
(NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME\line
THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line
THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF\line
THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED\line
HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\line
\line
8. TERMINATION.\line
\line
     This License and the rights granted hereunder will\line
terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms\line
herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of\line
becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered\line
Code which are properly granted shall survive any\line
termination of this License. Provisions which, by their\line
nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this\line
License shall survive.\line
\line
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\line
\line
     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY,\line
WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE,\line
SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY\line
DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH\line
PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY\line
INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF\line
ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR\line
LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR\line
MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR\line
LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE\line
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY\line
SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\line
RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT\line
APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS\line
DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR\line
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY\line
NOT APPLY TO YOU.\line
\line
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\line
\line
     The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term\line
is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of\line
"commercial computer software" and "commercial computer\line
software documentation," as such terms are used in 48\line
C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212\line
and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all\line
U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only\line
those rights set forth herein.\line
\line
11. MISCELLANEOUS.\line
\line
     This License represents the complete agreement\line
concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this\line
License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be\line
reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\line
enforceable. This License shall be governed by California\line
law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any,\line
provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law\line
provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one\line
party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered\line
to do business in, the United States of America: (a) unless\line
otherwise agreed in writing, all disputes relating to this\line
License (excepting any dispute relating to intellectual\line
property rights) shall be subject to final and binding\line
arbitration, with the losing party paying all costs of\line
arbitration; (b) any arbitration relating to this Agreement\line
shall be held in Santa Clara County, California, under the\line
auspices of JAMS/EndDispute; and (c) any litigation relating\line
to this Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of\line
the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California,\line
with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the\line
losing party responsible for costs, including without\line
limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and\line
expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention\line
on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is\line
expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides\line
that the language of a contract shall be construed against\line
the drafter shall not apply to this License.\line
\line
12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\line
\line
     Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to\line
comply with Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages\line
arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of\line
rights under this License, based on the number of copies of\line
Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received\line
from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors. You\line
agree to work with affected parties to distribute\line
responsibility on an equitable basis.\line

Eclipse Public License, version 1.0\line
<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>\line
Eclipse Public License - v 1.0\line
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\line
\line
1. DEFINITIONS\line
\line
"Contribution" means:\line
\line
a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\line
\line
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\line
\line
i) changes to the Program, and\line
\line
ii) additions to the Program;\line
\line
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\line
\line
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\line
\line
"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.\line
\line
"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\line
\line
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.\line
\line
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\line
\line
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\line
\line
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\line
\line
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\line
\line
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\line
\line
3. REQUIREMENTS\line
\line
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\line
\line
a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\line
\line
b) its license agreement:\line
\line
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\line
\line
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\line
\line
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\line
\line
iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\line
\line
When the Program is made available in source code form:\line
\line
a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\line
\line
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\line
\line
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.\line
\line
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\line
\line
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\line
\line
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\line
\line
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\line
\line
5. NO WARRANTY\line
\line
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\line
\line
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\line
\line
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\line
\line
7. GENERAL\line
\line
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\line
\line
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\line
\line
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\line
\line
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\line
\line
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.\line

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION\line
<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>\line
Version 3.1, 31 March 2009\line
\line
Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\line
\line
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this\line
license document, but changing it is not allowed.\line
\line
This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional\line
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version\line
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that\line
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\line
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\line
\line
When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\line
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\line
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\line
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\line
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\line
\line
0. Definitions.\line
\line
A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime\line
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\line
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\line
on the Runtime Library.\line
\line
"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\line
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\line
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\line
subsequent versions published by the FSF.\line
\line
"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,\line
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\line
the license of GCC.\line
\line
"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\line
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\line
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\line
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\line
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\line
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.\line
\line
The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in\line
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\line
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\line
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\line
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\line
understood as starting with the output of the generators or\line
preprocessors.\line
\line
A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or\line
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\line
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\line
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\line
Eligible Compilation Process.\line
\line
1. Grant of Additional Permission.\line
\line
You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\line
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\line
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\line
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\line
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\line
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\line
\line
2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\line
\line
The availability of this Exception does not imply any general\line
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\line
requirements of the license of GCC.\line

<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>\line
                GNU Free Documentation License\line
                   Version 1.1, March 2000\line
\line
 Copyright (C) 2000  Free Software Foundation, Inc.\line
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\line
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\line
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\line
\line
\line
0. PREAMBLE\line
\line
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other\line
written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone\line
the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without\line
modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,\line
this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get\line
credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for\line
modifications made by others.\line
\line
This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative\line
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It\line
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft\line
license designed for free software.\line
\line
We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free\line
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free\line
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the\line
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;\line
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or\line
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License\line
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\line
\line
\line
1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\line
\line
This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a\line
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed\line
under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any\line
such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is\line
addressed as "you".\line
\line
A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the\line
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with\line
modifications and/or translated into another language.\line
\line
A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of\line
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the\line
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject\line
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly\line
within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a\line
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any\line
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical\line
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,\line
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding\line
them.\line
\line
The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles\line
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice\line
that says that the Document is released under this License.\line
\line
The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,\line
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that\line
the Document is released under this License.\line
\line
A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,\line
represented in a format whose specification is available to the\line
general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and\line
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of\line
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available\line
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or\line
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input\line
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file\line
format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage\line
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is\line
not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".\line
\line
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain\line
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML\line
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple\line
HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include\line
PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only\line
by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or\line
processing tools are not generally available, and the\line
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output\line
purposes only.\line
\line
The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,\line
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material\line
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in\line
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means\line
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,\line
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.\line
\line
\line
2. VERBATIM COPYING\line
\line
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either\line
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the\line
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies\line
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other\line
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use\line
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further\line
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept\line
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough\line
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\line
\line
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and\line
you may publicly display copies.\line
\line
\line
3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\line
\line
If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,\line
and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose\line
the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover\line
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on\line
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify\line
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present\line
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and\line
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.\line
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve\line
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated\line
as verbatim copying in other respects.\line
\line
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit\line
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit\line
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent\line
pages.\line
\line
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering\line
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent\line
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy\line
a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete\line
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the\line
general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no\line
charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter\line
option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin\line
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this\line
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location\line
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque\line
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to\line
the public.\line
\line
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the\line
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give\line
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\line
\line
\line
4. MODIFICATIONS\line
\line
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under\line
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release\line
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified\line
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution\line
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy\line
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\line
\line
A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct\line
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions\line
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section\line
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version\line
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\line
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities\line
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified\line
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the\line
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).\line
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the\line
   Modified Version, as the publisher.\line
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\line
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications\line
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.\line
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice\line
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the\line
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\line
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections\line
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.\line
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.\line
I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to\line
   it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and\line
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If\line
   there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one\line
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as\line
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified\line
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.\line
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for\line
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise\line
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions\line
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.\line
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at\line
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original\line
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\line
K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",\line
   preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the\line
   substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements\line
   and/or dedications given therein.\line
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,\line
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers\line
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\line
M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section\line
   may not be included in the Modified Version.\line
N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"\line
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\line
\line
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or\line
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material\line
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all\line
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the\line
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.\line
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\line
\line
You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains\line
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various\line
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has\line
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a\line
standard.\line
\line
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a\line
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list\line
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of\line
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or\line
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already\line
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or\line
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,\line
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit\line
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\line
\line
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License\line
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or\line
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.\line
\line
\line
5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\line
\line
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this\line
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified\line
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the\line
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and\line
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its\line
license notice.\line
\line
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and\line
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single\line
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but\line
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by\line
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original\line
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.\line
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of\line
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\line
\line
In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"\line
in the various original documents, forming one section entitled\line
"History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",\line
and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections\line
entitled "Endorsements."\line
\line
\line
6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\line
\line
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents\line
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this\line
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in\line
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for\line
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\line
\line
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute\line
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this\line
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all\line
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\line
\line
\line
7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\line
\line
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate\line
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or\line
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version\line
of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the\line
compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this\line
License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled\line
with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they\line
are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\line
\line
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these\line
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter\line
of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on\line
covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.\line
Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.\line
\line
\line
8. TRANSLATION\line
\line
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may\line
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.\line
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special\line
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include\line
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the\line
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a\line
translation of this License provided that you also include the\line
original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement\line
between the translation and the original English version of this\line
License, the original English version will prevail.\line
\line
\line
9. TERMINATION\line
\line
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except\line
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to\line
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will\line
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,\line
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this\line
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\line
parties remain in full compliance.\line
\line
\line
10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\line
\line
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions\line
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new\line
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\line
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See\line
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.\line
\line
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.\line
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this\line
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of\line
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or\line
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the\line
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version\line
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not\line
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.\line
\line
\line
ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\line
\line
To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of\line
the License in the document and put the following copyright and\line
license notices just after the title page:\line
\line
      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.\line
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document\line
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1\line
      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;\line
      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the\line
      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\line
      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU\line
      Free Documentation License".\line
\line
If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"\line
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no\line
Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of\line
"Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.\line
\line
If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we\line
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of\line
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,\line
to permit their use in free software.\line

                GNU Free Documentation License\line
                  Version 1.2, November 2002\line

\line
 Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002  Free Software Foundation, Inc.\line
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\line
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\line
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\line
\line
\line
0. PREAMBLE\line
\line
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other\line
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to\line
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,\line
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.\line
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way\line
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible\line
for modifications made by others.\line
\line
This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative\line
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It\line
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft\line
license designed for free software.\line
\line
We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free\line
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free\line
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the\line
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;\line
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or\line
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License\line
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\line
\line
\line
1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\line
\line
This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that\line
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be\line
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a\line
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that\line
work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,\line
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a\line
licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you\line
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission\line
under copyright law.\line
\line
A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the\line
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with\line
modifications and/or translated into another language.\line
\line
A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of\line
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the\line
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject\line
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly\line
within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a\line
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any\line
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical\line
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,\line
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding\line
them.\line
\line
The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles\line
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice\line
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a\line
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not\line
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero\line
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant\line
Sections then there are none.\line
\line
The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,\line
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that\line
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may\line
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\line
\line
A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,\line
represented in a format whose specification is available to the\line
general public, that is suitable for revising the document\line
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of\line
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available\line
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or\line
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input\line
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file\line
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart\line
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.\line
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount\line
of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".\line
\line
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain\line
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML\line
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple\line
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of\line
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats\line
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by\line
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or\line
processing tools are not generally available, and the\line
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word\line
processors for output purposes only.\line
\line
The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,\line
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material\line
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in\line
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means\line
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,\line
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.\line
\line
A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose\line
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following\line
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a\line
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",\line
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"\line
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a\line
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.\line
\line
The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which\line
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty\line
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this\line
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other\line
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has\line
no effect on the meaning of this License.\line
\line
\line
2. VERBATIM COPYING\line
\line
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either\line
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the\line
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies\line
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other\line
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use\line
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further\line
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept\line
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough\line
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\line
\line
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and\line
you may publicly display copies.\line
\line
\line
3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\line
\line
If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have\line
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the\line
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the\line
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover\line
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on\line
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify\line
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present\line
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and\line
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.\line
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve\line
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated\line
as verbatim copying in other respects.\line
\line
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit\line
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit\line
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent\line
pages.\line
\line
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering\line
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent\line
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy\line
a computer-network location from which the general network-using\line
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols\line
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.\line
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,\line
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure\line
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated\line
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an\line
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that\line
edition to the public.\line
\line
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the\line
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give\line
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\line
\line
\line
4. MODIFICATIONS\line
\line
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under\line
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release\line
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified\line
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution\line
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy\line
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\line
\line
A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct\line
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions\line
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section\line
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version\line
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\line
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities\line
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified\line
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the\line
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),\line
   unless they release you from this requirement.\line
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the\line
   Modified Version, as the publisher.\line
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\line
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications\line
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.\line
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice\line
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the\line
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\line
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections\line
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.\line
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.\line
I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add\line
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and\line
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If\line
   there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one\line
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as\line
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified\line
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.\line
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for\line
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise\line
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions\line
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.\line
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at\line
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original\line
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\line
K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",\line
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all\line
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements\line
   and/or dedications given therein.\line
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,\line
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers\line
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\line
M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section\line
   may not be included in the Modified Version.\line
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"\line
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\line
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\line
\line
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or\line
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material\line
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all\line
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the\line
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.\line
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\line
\line
You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains\line
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various\line
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has\line
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a\line
standard.\line
\line
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a\line
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list\line
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of\line
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or\line
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already\line
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or\line
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,\line
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit\line
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\line
\line
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License\line
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or\line
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.\line
\line
\line
5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\line
\line
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this\line
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified\line
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the\line
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and\line
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its\line
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\line
\line
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and\line
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single\line
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but\line
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by\line
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original\line
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.\line
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of\line
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\line
\line
In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"\line
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled\line
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",\line
and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections\line
Entitled "Endorsements".\line
\line
\line
6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\line
\line
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents\line
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this\line
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in\line
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for\line
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\line
\line
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute\line
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this\line
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all\line
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\line
\line
\line
7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\line
\line
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate\line
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or\line
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright\line
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights\line
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.\line
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not\line
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves\line
derivative works of the Document.\line
\line
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these\line
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of\line
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on\line
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the\line
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.\line
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole\line
aggregate.\line
\line
\line
8. TRANSLATION\line
\line
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may\line
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.\line
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special\line
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include\line
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the\line
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a\line
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the\line
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include\line
the original English version of this License and the original versions\line
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between\line
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice\line
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\line
\line
If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",\line
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve\line
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual\line
title.\line
\line
\line
9. TERMINATION\line
\line
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except\line
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to\line
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will\line
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,\line
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this\line
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\line
parties remain in full compliance.\line
\line
\line
10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\line
\line
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions\line
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new\line
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\line
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See\line
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.\line
\line
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.\line
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this\line
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of\line
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or\line
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the\line
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version\line
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not\line
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.\line
\line
\line
ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\line
\line
To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of\line
the License in the document and put the following copyright and\line
license notices just after the title page:\line
\line
    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.\line
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document\line
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2\line
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;\line
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.\line
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU\line
    Free Documentation License".\line
\line
If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,\line
replace the "with...Texts." line with this:\line
\line
    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the\line
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\line
\line
If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other\line
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the\line
situation.\line
\line
If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we\line
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of\line
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,\line
to permit their use in free software.\line

 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\line
\line
                            Preamble\line
\line
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\line
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\line
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\line
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\line
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software\line
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\line
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\line
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\line
your programs, too.\line
\line
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\line
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\line
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\line
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\line
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\line
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\line
\line
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\line
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\line
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\line
\line
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\line
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\line
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\line
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\line
rights.\line
\line
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\line
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\line
distribute and/or modify the software.\line
\line
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\line
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\line
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\line
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\line
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\line
authors' reputations.\line
\line
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\line
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\line
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\line
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\line
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\line
\line
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line
modification follow.\line
\line
                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line
\line
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\line
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\line
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,\line
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"\line
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\line
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\line
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\line
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\line
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".\line
\line
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\line
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\line
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\line
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\line
\line
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\line
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\line
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\line
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\line
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\line
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\line
along with the Program.\line
\line
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\line
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\line
\line
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\line
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\line
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line
\line
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\line
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line
\line
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\line
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\line
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\line
    parties under the terms of this License.\line
\line
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\line
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\line
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\line
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\line
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\line
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\line
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\line
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\line
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\line
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\line
\line
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\line
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\line
\line
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line
collective works based on the Program.\line
\line
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\line
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\line
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line
the scope of this License.\line
\line
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\line
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\line
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\line
\line
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\line
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\line
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\line
\line
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\line
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\line
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\line
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\line
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\line
    customarily used for software interchange; or,\line
\line
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\line
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\line
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\line
    received the program in object code or executable form with such\line
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\line
\line
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\line
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\line
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\line
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\line
special exception, the source code distributed need not include\line
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\line
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\line
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\line
itself accompanies the executable.\line
\line
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\line
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\line
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as\line
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\line
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line
\line
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\line
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\line
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\line
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\line
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\line
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\line
parties remain in full compliance.\line
\line
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\line
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\line
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line
the Program or works based on it.\line
\line
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\line
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\line
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\line
this License.\line
\line
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\line
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\line
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\line
\line
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\line
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\line
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\line
circumstances.\line
\line
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is\line
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\line
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line
impose that choice.\line
\line
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line
be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line
\line
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\line
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License\line
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\line
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\line
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\line
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\line
\line
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\line
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\line
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\line
address new problems or concerns.\line
\line
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\line
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any\line
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\line
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free\line
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\line
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\line
Foundation.\line
\line
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\line
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\line
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\line
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\line
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\line
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\line
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\line
\line
                            NO WARRANTY\line
\line
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\line
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\line
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\line
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\line
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\line
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\line
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\line
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\line
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line
\line
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\line
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\line
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\line
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\line
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\line
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\line
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\line
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\line
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\line
\line
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line
\line
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\line
\line
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\line
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\line
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\line
\line
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\line
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\line
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\line
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\line
\line
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\line
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\line
\line
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\line
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\line
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\line
    (at your option) any later version.\line
\line
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\line
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\line
    GNU General Public License for more details.\line
\line
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\line
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\line
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\line
\line
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\line
\line
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\line
when it starts in an interactive mode:\line
\line
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\line
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\line
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\line
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\line
\line
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\line
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\line
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\line
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\line
\line
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\line
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if\line
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\line
\line
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\line
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\line
\line
  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\line
  Ty Coon, President of Vice\line
\line
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\line
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\line
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\line
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\line
Public License instead of this License.\line

GNU General Public License, version 3\line
<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>\line
                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\line
\line
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\line
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\line
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\line
\line
                            Preamble\line
\line
  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\line
software and other kinds of works.\line
\line
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\line
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\line
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\line
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\line
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\line
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\line
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\line
your programs, too.\line
\line
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\line
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\line
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\line
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\line
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\line
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\line
\line
  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\line
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\line
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\line
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\line
\line
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\line
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\line
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\line
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\line
know their rights.\line
\line
  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\line
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\line
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\line
\line
  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\line
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\line
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\line
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\line
authors of previous versions.\line
\line
  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\line
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\line
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\line
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\line
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\line
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\line
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\line
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\line
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\line
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\line
\line
  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\line
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\line
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\line
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\line
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\line
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\line
\line
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line
modification follow.\line
\line
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line
\line
  0. Definitions.\line
\line
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\line
\line
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\line
works, such as semiconductor masks.\line
\line
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\line
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and\line
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.\line
\line
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\line
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\line
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the\line
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.\line
\line
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\line
on the Program.\line
\line
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without\line
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\line
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\line
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\line
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the\line
public, and in some countries other activities as well.\line
\line
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\line
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\line
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\line
\line
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"\line
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\line
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\line
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\line
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\line
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\line
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\line
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\line
\line
  1. Source Code.\line
\line
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work\line
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source\line
form of a work.\line
\line
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official\line
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\line
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\line
is widely used among developers working in that language.\line
\line
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other\line
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\line
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\line
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\line
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\line
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\line
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component\line
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\line
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\line
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\line
\line
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all\line
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\line
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\line
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\line
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\line
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\line
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\line
includes interface definition files associated with source files for\line
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\line
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\line
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\line
subprograms and other parts of the work.\line
\line
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\line
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\line
Source.\line
\line
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\line
same work.\line
\line
  2. Basic Permissions.\line
\line
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\line
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\line
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\line
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\line
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\line
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\line
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\line
\line
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\line
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\line
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\line
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\line
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\line
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\line
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\line
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\line
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\line
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\line
\line
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\line
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\line
makes it unnecessary.\line
\line
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\line
\line
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\line
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\line
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\line
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\line
measures.\line
\line
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\line
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\line
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\line
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\line
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\line
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\line
technological measures.\line
\line
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\line
\line
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\line
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\line
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\line
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any\line
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\line
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\line
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\line
\line
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\line
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\line
\line
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\line
\line
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\line
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\line
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line
\line
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\line
    it, and giving a relevant date.\line
\line
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\line
    released under this License and any conditions added under section\line
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\line
    "keep intact all notices".\line
\line
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\line
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\line
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\line
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\line
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\line
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\line
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\line
\line
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\line
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\line
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\line
    work need not make them do so.\line
\line
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\line
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\line
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\line
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\line
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\line
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\line
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\line
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\line
parts of the aggregate.\line
\line
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\line
\line
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\line
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\line
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\line
in one of these ways:\line
\line
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\line
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\line
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\line
    customarily used for software interchange.\line
\line
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\line
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\line
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\line
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\line
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\line
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\line
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\line
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\line
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\line
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\line
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\line
\line
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\line
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\line
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\line
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\line
    with subsection 6b.\line
\line
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\line
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\line
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\line
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\line
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\line
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\line
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\line
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\line
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\line
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\line
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\line
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\line
\line
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\line
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\line
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\line
    charge under subsection 6d.\line
\line
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\line
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\line
included in conveying the object code work.\line
\line
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any\line
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\line
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\line
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\line
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\line
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a\line
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\line
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\line
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\line
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\line
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\line
the only significant mode of use of the product.\line
\line
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,\line
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\line
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\line
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\line
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\line
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\line
modification has been made.\line
\line
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\line
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\line
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\line
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\line
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\line
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\line
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\line
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\line
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\line
been installed in ROM).\line
\line
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\line
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\line
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\line
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\line
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and\line
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\line
protocols for communication across the network.\line
\line
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\line
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\line
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in\line
source code form), and must require no special password or key for\line
unpacking, reading or copying.\line
\line
  7. Additional Terms.\line
\line
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this\line
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\line
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\line
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\line
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\line
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\line
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\line
this License without regard to the additional permissions.\line
\line
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\line
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\line
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\line
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\line
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\line
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\line
\line
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\line
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\line
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\line
\line
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\line
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\line
\line
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\line
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\line
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\line
\line
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\line
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\line
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\line
\line
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\line
    authors of the material; or\line
\line
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\line
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\line
\line
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\line
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\line
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\line
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\line
    those licensors and authors.\line
\line
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further\line
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\line
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\line
governed by this License along with a term that is a further\line
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\line
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\line
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\line
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does\line
not survive such relicensing or conveying.\line
\line
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\line
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\line
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\line
where to find the applicable terms.\line
\line
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\line
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\line
the above requirements apply either way.\line
\line
  8. Termination.\line
\line
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\line
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\line
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\line
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\line
paragraph of section 11).\line
\line
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\line
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\line
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\line
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\line
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\line
prior to 60 days after the cessation.\line
\line
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\line
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\line
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\line
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\line
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\line
your receipt of the notice.\line
\line
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\line
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\line
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\line
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\line
material under section 10.\line
\line
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\line
\line
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\line
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\line
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\line
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\line
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\line
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\line
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\line
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\line
\line
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\line
\line
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\line
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\line
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\line
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\line
\line
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an\line
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\line
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\line
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that\line
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\line
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\line
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\line
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\line
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\line
\line
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\line
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\line
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\line
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\line
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\line
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\line
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\line
\line
  11. Patents.\line
\line
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\line
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\line
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".\line
\line
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims\line
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\line
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\line
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\line
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\line
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\line
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant\line
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\line
this License.\line
\line
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\line
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\line
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\line
propagate the contents of its contributor version.\line
\line
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express\line
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\line
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\line
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a\line
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\line
patent against the party.\line
\line
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\line
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\line
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\line
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\line
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\line
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\line
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\line
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\line
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have\line
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\line
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\line
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\line
country that you have reason to believe are valid.\line
\line
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\line
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\line
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\line
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\line
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\line
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\line
work and works based on it.\line
\line
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within\line
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\line
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\line
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\line
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\line
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\line
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\line
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\line
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\line
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\line
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\line
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that\line
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\line
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\line
\line
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\line
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\line
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\line
\line
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\line
\line
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\line
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\line
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\line
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\line
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\line
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\line
\line
  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\line
\line
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\line
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\line
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\line
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\line
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\line
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\line
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\line
combination as such.\line
\line
  14. Revised Versions of this License.\line
\line
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\line
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\line
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\line
address new problems or concerns.\line
\line
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\line
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\line
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the\line
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\line
version or of any later version published by the Free Software\line
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\line
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\line
by the Free Software Foundation.\line
\line
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\line
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\line
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\line
to choose that version for the Program.\line
\line
  Later license versions may give you additional or different\line
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\line
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\line
later version.\line
\line
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\line
\line
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\line
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\line
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY\line
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\line
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\line
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\line
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\line
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line
\line
  16. Limitation of Liability.\line
\line
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\line
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\line
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\line
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\line
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\line
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\line
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\line
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\line
SUCH DAMAGES.\line
\line
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\line
\line
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\line
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\line
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\line
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\line
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\line
copy of the Program in return for a fee.\line
\line
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line
\line
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\line
\line
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\line
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\line
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\line
\line
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\line
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\line
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\line
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\line
\line
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\line
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\line
\line
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\line
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\line
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\line
    (at your option) any later version.\line
\line
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\line
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\line
    GNU General Public License for more details.\line
\line
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\line
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\line
\line
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\line
\line
  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\line
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\line
\line
    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\line
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\line
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\line
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\line
\line
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\line
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\line
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".\line
\line
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\line
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.\line
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\line
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\line
\line
  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\line
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\line
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\line
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\line
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read\line

GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1\line
<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>\line
                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line
                       Version 2.1, February 1999\line
\line
 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\line
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\line
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\line
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\line
\line
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts\line
 as the successor of the GNU Library General Public License, version 2, hence\line
 the version number 2.1.]\line
\line
                            Preamble\line
\line
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\line
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\line
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\line
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\line
\line
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\line
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\line
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\line
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\line
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\line
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\line
\line
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\line
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\line
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\line
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\line
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\line
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\line
these things.\line
\line
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\line
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\line
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\line
\line
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\line
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\line
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\line
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line
\line
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\line
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\line
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line
\line
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\line
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\line
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\line
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\line
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\line
introduced by others.\line
\line
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\line
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\line
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\line
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\line
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\line
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\line
\line
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\line
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\line
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\line
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\line
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\line
libraries into non-free programs.\line
\line
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\line
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\line
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\line
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\line
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\line
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\line
the library.\line
\line
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\line
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\line
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\line
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\line
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\line
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\line
special circumstances.\line
\line
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\line
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\line
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\line
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\line
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\line
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\line
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\line
\line
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\line
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\line
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\line
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\line
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\line
system.\line
\line
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\line
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\line
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\line
that program using a modified version of the Library.\line
\line
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\line
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\line
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\line
be combined with the library in order to run.\line
\line
                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line
\line
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\line
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\line
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\line
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").\line
Each licensee is addressed as "you".\line
\line
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\line
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\line
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\line
\line
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\line
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\line
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\line
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\line
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\line
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\line
included without limitation in the term "modification".)\line
\line
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\line
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\line
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\line
and installation of the library.\line
\line
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\line
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\line
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\line
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\line
and what the program that uses the Library does.\line
\line
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\line
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\line
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\line
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\line
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\line
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\line
Library.\line
\line
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\line
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\line
fee.\line
\line
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\line
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\line
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line
\line
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\line
\line
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\line
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line
\line
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\line
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\line
\line
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\line
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\line
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\line
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\line
    in the event an application does not supply such function or\line
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\line
    its purpose remains meaningful.\line
\line
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\line
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\line
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\line
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\line
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\line
    root function must still compute square roots.)\line
\line
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\line
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\line
it.\line
\line
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line
collective works based on the Library.\line
\line
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\line
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\line
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line
the scope of this License.\line
\line
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\line
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\line
these notices.\line
\line
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line
\line
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line
the Library into a program that is not a library.\line
\line
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line
medium customarily used for software interchange.\line
\line
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line
\line
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\line
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line
\line
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line
\line
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\line
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line
\line
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line
Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line
\line
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line
\line
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\line
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line
engineering for debugging such modifications.\line
\line
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\line
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\line
of these things:\line
\line
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\line
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line
    to use the modified definitions.)\line
\line
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\line
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\line
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\line
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\line
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\line
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\line
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\line
\line
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\line
    least three years, to give the same user the materials\line
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\line
    than the cost of performing this distribution.\line
\line
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line
    specified materials from the same place.\line
\line
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line
\line
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\line
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\line
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line
the executable.\line
\line
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\line
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line
distribute.\line
\line
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\line
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\line
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\line
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\line
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\line
\line
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\line
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\line
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\line
    Sections above.\line
\line
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\line
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\line
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line
\line
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\line
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\line
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\line
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\line
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\line
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\line
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\line
\line
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\line
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\line
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line
the Library or works based on it.\line
\line
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\line
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\line
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\line
this License.\line
\line
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\line
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\line
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\line
\line
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\line
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\line
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\line
\line
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line
integrity of the free software distribution system which is\line
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\line
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line
impose that choice.\line
\line
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line
be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line
\line
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\line
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\line
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\line
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\line
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\line
written in the body of this License.\line
\line
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\line
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\line
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\line
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line
\line
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\line
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\line
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\line
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\line
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\line
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\line
the Free Software Foundation.\line
\line
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\line
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\line
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\line
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\line
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\line
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\line
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\line
and reuse of software generally.\line
\line
                            NO WARRANTY\line
\line
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\line
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\line
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\line
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\line
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\line
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\line
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\line
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\line
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line
\line
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\line
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\line
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\line
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\line
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\line
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\line
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\line
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\line
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\line
DAMAGES.\line
\line
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line
\line
           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\line
\line
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\line
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\line
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\line
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\line
ordinary General Public License).\line
\line
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\line
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\line
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\line
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\line
\line
    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\line
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\line
\line
    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\line
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\line
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\line
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\line
\line
    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\line
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\line
    Lesser General Public License for more details.\line
\line
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\line
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\line
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\line
\line
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\line
\line
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\line
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if\line
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\line
\line
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\line
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.\line

GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3\line
<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>\line
                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\line
\line
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\line
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\line
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\line
\line
\line
  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates\line
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public\line
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.\line
\line
  0. Additional Definitions.\line
\line
  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\line
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU\line
General Public License.\line
\line
  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\line
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\line
\line
  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\line
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\line
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\line
of using an interface provided by the Library.\line
\line
  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an\line
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\line
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked\line
Version".\line
\line
  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the\line
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\line
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\line
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\line
\line
  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the\line
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\line
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\line
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\line
\line
  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\line
\line
  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\line
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\line
\line
  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\line
\line
  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\line
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\line
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\line
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\line
version:\line
\line
   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\line
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\line
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\line
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\line
\line
   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\line
   this License applicable to that copy.\line
\line
  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\line
\line
  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\line
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\line
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\line
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\line
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\line
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\line
\line
   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\line
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\line
   covered by this License.\line
\line
   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\line
   document.\line
\line
  4. Combined Works.\line
\line
  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\line
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\line
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\line
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\line
the following:\line
\line
   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\line
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\line
   covered by this License.\line
\line
   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\line
   document.\line
\line
   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\line
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\line
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\line
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\line
\line
   d) Do one of the following:\line
\line
       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\line
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\line
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\line
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\line
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\line
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\line
       Corresponding Source.\line
\line
       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\line
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\line
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\line
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\line
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\line
       Version.\line
\line
   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\line
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\line
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\line
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\line
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\line
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\line
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\line
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\line
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\line
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\line
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\line
\line
  5. Combined Libraries.\line
\line
  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line
Library side by side in a single library together with other library\line
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\line
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\line
choice, if you do both of the following:\line
\line
   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\line
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\line
   conveyed under the terms of this License.\line
\line
   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\line
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\line
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line
\line
  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\line
\line
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\line
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\line
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\line
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line
\line
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\line
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\line
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"\line
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\line
conditions either of that published version or of any later version\line
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\line
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\line
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\line
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\line
\line
  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\line
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\line
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\line
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\line
Library.\line

GNU Library General Public License, version 2\line
<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>\line
		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line
		       Version 2, June 1991\line
\line
 Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\line
 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA\line
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\line
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\line
\line
[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is\line
 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\line
\line
			    Preamble\line
\line
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\line
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\line
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\line
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\line
\line
  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some\line
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any\line
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for\line
your libraries, too.\line
\line
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\line
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\line
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\line
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\line
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\line
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\line
\line
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\line
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if\line
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\line
\line
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line
code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide\line
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them\line
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling\line
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line
\line
  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright\line
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\line
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line
\line
  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain\line
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\line
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we\line
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original\line
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on\line
the original authors' reputations.\line
\line
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\line
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free\line
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect\line
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,\line
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's\line
free use or not licensed at all.\line
\line
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary\line
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This\line
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain\line
designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary\line
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is\line
the same as in the ordinary license.\line
\line
  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\line
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a\line
program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without\line
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is\line
analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in\line
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a\line
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License\line
treats it as such.\line
\line
  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General\line
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software\line
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We\line
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\line
\line
  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the\line
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the\line
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to\line
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while\line
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\line
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve\line
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards\line
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this\line
will lead to faster development of free libraries.\line
\line
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\line
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\line
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only\line
works together with the library.\line
\line
  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary\line
General Public License rather than by this special one.\line
\line
		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line
\line
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which\line
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized\line
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library\line
General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is\line
addressed as "you".\line
\line
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\line
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\line
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\line
\line
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\line
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\line
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\line
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\line
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\line
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\line
included without limitation in the term "modification".)\line
\line
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\line
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\line
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\line
and installation of the library.\line
\line
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\line
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\line
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\line
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\line
and what the program that uses the Library does.\line
  \line
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\line
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\line
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\line
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\line
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\line
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\line
Library.\line
\line
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\line
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\line
fee.\line
\line
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\line
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\line
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line
\line
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\line
\line
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\line
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line
\line
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\line
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\line
\line
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\line
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\line
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\line
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\line
    in the event an application does not supply such function or\line
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\line
    its purpose remains meaningful.\line
\line
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\line
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\line
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\line
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\line
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\line
    root function must still compute square roots.)\line
\line
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\line
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\line
it.\line
\line
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line
collective works based on the Library.\line
\line
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\line
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\line
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line
the scope of this License.\line
\line
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\line
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\line
these notices.\line
\line
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line
\line
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line
the Library into a program that is not a library.\line
\line
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line
medium customarily used for software interchange.\line
\line
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line
\line
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\line
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line
\line
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line
\line
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\line
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line
\line
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line
Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line
\line
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line
\line
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or\line
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line
engineering for debugging such modifications.\line
\line
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\line
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\line
of these things:\line
\line
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\line
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line
    to use the modified definitions.)\line
\line
    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\line
    least three years, to give the same user the materials\line
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\line
    than the cost of performing this distribution.\line
\line
    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line
    specified materials from the same place.\line
\line
    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line
\line
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\line
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally\line
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line
the executable.\line
\line
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\line
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line
distribute.\line
\line
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\line
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\line
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\line
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\line
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\line
\line
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\line
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\line
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\line
    Sections above.\line
\line
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\line
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\line
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line
\line
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\line
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\line
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\line
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\line
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\line
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\line
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\line
\line
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\line
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\line
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line
the Library or works based on it.\line
\line
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\line
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\line
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\line
this License.\line
\line
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\line
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\line
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\line
\line
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\line
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\line
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\line
\line
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line
integrity of the free software distribution system which is\line
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\line
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line
impose that choice.\line
\line
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line
be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line
\line
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\line
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\line
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\line
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\line
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\line
written in the body of this License.\line
\line
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\line
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.\line
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\line
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line
\line
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\line
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\line
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\line
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\line
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\line
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\line
the Free Software Foundation.\line
\line
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\line
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\line
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\line
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\line
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\line
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\line
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\line
and reuse of software generally.\line
\line
			    NO WARRANTY\line
\line
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\line
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\line
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\line
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\line
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\line
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\line
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\line
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\line
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line
\line
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\line
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\line
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\line
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\line
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\line
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\line
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\line
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\line
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\line
DAMAGES.\line
\line
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line
\line
     Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\line
\line
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\line
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\line
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\line
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\line
ordinary General Public License).\line
\line
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\line
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\line
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\line
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\line
\line
    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\line
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\line
\line
    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\line
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\line
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\line
    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\line
\line
    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\line
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\line
    Library General Public License for more details.\line
\line
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public\line
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free\line
    Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston,\line
    MA 02111-1307, USA\line
\line
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\line
\line
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\line
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if\line
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\line
\line
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\line
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.\line

\line
METRO LINK PUBLIC LICENSE \line
MOTIF GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE SOFTWARE\line
Version 1.00\line
\line
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS METRO LINK PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. \line
\line
1. DEFINITIONS \line
\line
"Contribution" means: \line
\line
a.  in the case of METRO LINK, INCORPORATED ("METRO LINK"), the Metro Link Program, and \line
 \line
b.  in the case of each Contributor, \line
 \line
1. changes to the Program, and \line
2. additions to the Program; \line
 \line
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. \line
\line
"Contributor" means The Open Group, METRO LINK and any other entity that distributes the Program. \line
\line
"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program. \line
\line
"Open Source"  programs mean software for the source code is available without confidential or trade secret restrictions and for which  the source code and object code are available for distribution without license charges. \line
\line
"Metro Link Program" means the original version of the software accompanying this Agreement as released by METRO LINK, including source code, object code and documentation, if any. \line
\line
"Program" means the Metro Link Program and Contributions.  \line
\line
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.  \line
\line
2.     GRANT OF RIGHTS  \line
\line
The rights granted under this license are limited solely to distribution and sublicensing of the Contribution(s) on, with or  for operating systems which are themselves Open Source programs. \line
\line
a. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, The Open Group Public License Agreement attached hereto (ìThe Open Group Agreementî) and  the limitations of this Section 2, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form. \line
 \line
b. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, The Open Group Agreement and this Section 2, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder. \line
 \line
c. Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program. \line
 \line
d. Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement. \line
 \line
3. REQUIREMENTS \line
\line
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that: \line
\line
a. it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and The Open Group Agreement; and  \line
\line
b. its license agreement:  \line
\line
1. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; \line
\line
2. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; \line
\line
3. states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and \line
\line
4. states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.  \line
\line
When the Program is made available in source code form: \line
\line
a. it must be made available under this Agreement and the Open Group Agreement; and  \line
\line
b. a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.  \line
\line
Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program: \line
\line
Copyright (C) May, 2000 The Open Group, Metro Link, Incorporated and others. All Rights Reserved \line
\line
In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. \line
\line
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION \line
\line
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:  \line
\line
a)       promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and  \line
\line
b)       allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations.  \line
\line
The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. \line
\line
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. \line
\line
5. NO WARRANTY \line
\line
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. \line
\line
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY \line
\line
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. \line
\line
7. GENERAL \line
\line
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.  \line
\line
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.  \line
\line
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.  \line
\line
METRO LINK may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than METRO LINK has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.  \line
\line
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Florida and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. \line
\line
No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.\line

\line
3. Distribution Obligations.\line
\line
     3.1. Application of License.\line
     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are\line
     governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation\line
     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be\line
     distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version\line
     of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a\line
     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You\line
     distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code\line
     version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this\line
     License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include\line
     an additional document offering the additional rights described in\line
     Section 3.5.\line
\line
     3.2. Availability of Source Code.\line
     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be\line
     made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License\line
     either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted\line
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an\line
     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic\line
     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)\line
     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six\line
     (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification\line
     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for\line
     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the\line
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\line
\line
     3.3. Description of Modifications.\line
     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a\line
     file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and\line
     the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that\line
     the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original\line
     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the\line
     Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an\line
     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the\line
     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\line
\line
     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\line
          (a) Third Party Claims.\line
          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's\line
          intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights\line
          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,\line
          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code\line
          distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the\line
          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will\line
          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after\line
          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,\line
          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies\line
          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps\line
          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)\line
          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered\line
          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\line
\line
          (b) Contributor APIs.\line
          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming\line
          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which\line
          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must\line
          also include this information in the LEGAL file.\line
\line
               (c)    Representations.\line
          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to\line
          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's\line
          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or\line
          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by\line
          this License.\line
\line
     3.5. Required Notices.\line
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source\line
     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source\line
     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a\line
     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely\line
     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)\line
     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in\line
     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation\line
     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership\line
     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to\line
     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability\line
     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You\line
     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial\line
     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than\line
     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is\line
     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\line
     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the\line
     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,\line
     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\line
\line
     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\line
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\line
     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,\line
     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of\line
     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,\line
     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the\line
     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included\line
     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or\line
     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the\line
     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered\line
     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may\line
     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in\line
     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the\line
     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's\line
     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this\line
     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different\line
     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ\line
     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial\line
     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the\line
     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by\line
     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such\line
     terms You offer.\line
\line
     3.7. Larger Works.\line
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code\line
     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger\line
     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the\line
     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\line
\line
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\line
\line
     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\line
     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to\line
     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\line
     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\line
     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description\line
     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must\line
     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the\line
     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\line
     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\line
     understand it.\line
\line
5. Application of this License.\line
\line
     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\line
     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\line
\line
6. Versions of the License.\line
\line
     6.1. New Versions.\line
     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised\line
     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version\line
     will be given a distinguishing version number.\line
\line
     6.2. Effect of New Versions.\line
     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the\line
     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that\line
     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms\line
     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one\line
     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to\line
     Covered Code created under this License.\line
\line
     6.3. Derivative Works.\line
     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may\line
     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code\line
     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that\line
     the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",\line
     "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your\line
     license (except to note that your license differs from this License)\line
     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license\line
     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and\line
     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial\line
     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in\line
     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of\line
     this License.)\line
\line
7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\line
\line
     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,\line
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\line
     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF\line
     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.\line
     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE\line
     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,\line
     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE\line
     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER\line
     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF\line
     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\line
\line
8. TERMINATION.\line
\line
     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\line
     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\line
     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All\line
     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall\line
     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their\line
     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License\line
     shall survive.\line
\line
     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement\line
     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer\line
     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom\line
     You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:\line
\line
     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly\line
     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such\line
     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License\line
     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,\line
     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)\line
     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable\line
     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such\line
     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to\line
     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days\line
     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not\line
     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim\line
     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under\line
     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of\line
     the 60 day notice period specified above.\line
\line
     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's\line
     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then\line
     any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)\line
     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,\line
     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that\line
     Participant.\line
\line
     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\line
     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or\line
     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as\line
     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\line
     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\line
     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\line
     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\line
     license.\line
\line
     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,\line
     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)\line
     which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder\line
     prior to termination shall survive termination.\line
\line
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\line
\line
     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\line
     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL\line
     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,\line
     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR\line
     ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY\line
     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,\line
     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\line
     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\line
     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\line
     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\line
     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\line
     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\line
     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO\line
     THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\line
\line
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\line
\line
     The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in\line
     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer\line
     software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such\line
     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48\line
     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),\line
     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those\line
     rights set forth herein.\line
\line
11. MISCELLANEOUS.\line
\line
     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\line
     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\line
     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\line
     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by\line
     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if\line
     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.\line
     With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,\line
     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United\line
     States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be\line
     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern\line
     District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,\line
     California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including\line
     without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and\line
     expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on\line
     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\line
     Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract\line
     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this\line
     License.\line
\line
12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\line
\line
     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\line
     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,\line
     out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to\line
     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such\line
     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or\line
     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\line
\line
13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\line
\line
     Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as\line
     "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial\line
     Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under\line
     Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified\line
     by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.\line
