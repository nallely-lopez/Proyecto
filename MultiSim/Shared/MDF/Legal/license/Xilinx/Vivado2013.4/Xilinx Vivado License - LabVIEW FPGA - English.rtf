\tab \tab \tab A.\tab Certain Definitions.  "Distributable Component(s)" means those files supplied by Xilinx that are contained within certain Software tools (such as in EDK, Core Generator and System Generator) and that are identified by Xilinx in such tool or its associated documentation as either (a) an IP core (or a LogiCORE product), which is designed for use in programming functionality onto a Xilinx Device (hereafter a "Core"), or (b) a software driver (or a device driver), which is designed for use in enabling a Xilinx Device to interoperate with other independent software programs such as an operating system (hereafter a "Driver").  Distributable Components may be supplied by Xilinx in either (y) source code form, such as a Core provided in VHDL or Verilog form or a Driver provided in C language source form (hereafter "Modifiable Form"), or (z) a format other than source code, such as a Core provided in netlist form or encrypted netlist form or a Driver provided in complied object code form (hereafter "Restricted Form").  For purposes of clarity, a "Core" as used herein includes only a "Core" provided by Xilinx in the Software tools listed above at no additional charge, and not any fee-based LogiCORE products which are licensed separately under other agreements.}

Licensee shall have no right to modify a Distributable Component that is supplied by Xilinx in a Restricted Form. }

(a)\tab Collection and Transmission of Data.  "WebTalk" is a feature of the Software that electronically transmits to Xilinx various data relating to Licensee's use of the Software.  WebTalk does not transmit the actual logic designs or Bitstreams processed via the Software.  The types of data that WebTalk will transmit to Xilinx include: (i) constraint data (e.g., location assignments, clock and timing requirement and assignments, any constraints set via the Software graphical user interface), (ii) device data (e.g., targeted device and family), (iii) compilation data (e.g., device, memory and I/O utilization, time of compilation), (iv) design data (e.g., the number of each type of file used, intellectual property cores/LogiCORE IP cores logic functions used, and intellectual property parameterization), (v) Software data (e.g., synthesis, simulation and timing analysis tools used, and version and build of the Software), (vi) platform data (e.g., operating system, speed and number of processors and main memory), (vii) Authorization Codes data, (viii) Software errors log data (e.g., previous exit status), and (ix) help access data.  Xilinx may correlate the data collected by WebTalk (primarily via the Authorization Codes data) to determine the identity of the Licensee and the User.  WebTalk functions by bundling the collected data resulting from your use of the Software and writing it to html and/or xml files which are electronically transmitted over the internet to Xilinx by https (hypertext transfer protocol secure) post.  WebTalk collects and maintains the last usage_statistics_webtalk file that was meant for transmission for a given design.  Every new re-compilation of that given design will overwrite the previous file.  If the https post transmission fails, or an internet connection is not available at the time of attempted transmission, the data is stored as an html and/or xml file.  Once an internet connection is achieved by Licensee, the https post transmission will again be attempted upon re-compilation.  The operation of WebTalk will not materially affect the performance of the Software.}

(b)\tab Use, Protection and Disclosure of Data.  Xilinx uses the data received via WebTalk so that Xilinx can continuously improve the Software and other products, technologies and services that Xilinx offers to its customers, and also for sales and marketing email communications (for example, for selective announcement of new Xilinx products and services, distribution of marketing data, etc.).  Xilinx uses reasonable efforts to maintain the privacy of the data during transmission (as discussed above) and after receipt by Xilinx via "firewalls" and other commonly available physical and technical security measures.  However, due to technological limitations, the transmission of data through various internet service providers not under contract with Xilinx, and the risk of unlawful interceptions and accessing of transmissions and/or data, Xilinx cannot completely assure Licensee or Users, and Licensee and Users should not expect, that the data will be absolutely protected or confidential.  If you attempt to tamper with or modify the Software in any way (other than as expressly authorized by Xilinx in this Agreement), Xilinx disclaims all responsibility for the operation of WebTalk and for the collection, transmission and protection of data as described herein.  Xilinx may disclose data received via WebTalk to its corporate subsidiaries and to its authorized distributors and sales representatives (collectively, "Sales Partners"), which disclosures may be in a form that may be correlated to personally identify Licensee and Users, for their use of such data in the same manner as Xilinx might use such data.  Except for disclosures to its Sales Partners, the data received by Xilinx via WebTalk will not be intentionally disclosed by Xilinx to any third parties in a form that is knowingly capable of being correlated to personally identify Licensee and its Users; however, Xilinx may share this data in an aggregate form that does not knowingly identify Licensee and its Users with its business affiliates including without limitation electronic design automation (EDA) companies with whom Xilinx has a commercial relationship including, but not limited to, Synopsys, Mentor Graphics, and Cadence.  Xilinx also seeks to require Sales Partners and business affiliates to exercise reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of the data disclosed to them.  In addition to disclosures to Sales Partners, Xilinx may disclose personally identifiable data (collected by WebTalk and correlated to Licensee and Users), with or without prior notice, when Xilinx believes that the law requires it, in response to subpoenas or at the demand of governmental agencies, to protect its systems or business, or to respond to an emergency.  Further, Xilinx reserves the right to transfer any and all data collected by WebTalk from Licensee and Users to a third party in the event that Xilinx sells or transfers substantially all of its assets related to the Software to such third party.}

(c)\tab Enable/Disable.  Please note that WebTalk will collect and transmit certain data that may contain (or be correlated to reveal, primarily via the Authorization Codes data) personally identifiable information.  By agreeing to this Agreement, you hereby give your consent (on behalf of Licensee and Users) for Xilinx to use and disclose this information anywhere in the world for the purposes and as described in this Agreement.  Licensee or its Users may disable/enable WebTalk during installation or by editing the user preferences in Project Navigator, iMPACT, Vivado or PlanAhead or by running the xwebtalk command line utility which is located in your ise/bin/<os> folder, where os is nt, nt64, lin or lin64.  Please note that WebTalk data transmission is mandatory for ISE WebPACK and Vivado WebPACK software (which are made available by Xilinx at no charge) and for alpha, beta or similar early access versions of Xilinx software products, and WebTalk makes decisions on data transmission based on the Authorization Codes used for design compilation; the only exception to this mandatory transmission is if the software is used on a machine that is not connected to the internet.  If you obtained ISE WebPACK or Vivado WebPACk software (which are made available by Xilinx at no charge) and desire to have the ability to disable WebTalk, you may purchase a license to another version of the Software and not use the ISE WebPACK or Vivado WebPACK software.  Versions of the Software for which Xilinx is paid a license fee contain the capability for disabling WebTalk as described herein.}
