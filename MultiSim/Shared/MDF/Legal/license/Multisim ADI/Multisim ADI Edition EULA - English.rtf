You acknowledge that the applicable fees and prices reflect this allocation of risk. Because some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitation may not apply. If the foregoing limitation of liability is not enforceable because the SOFTWARE, the Third Party Software, the models (including the ADI Models), the services, or the hardware is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment to be defective and to have directly caused bodily injury, death, or property damage, in no event shall the aggregate liability of NI, its licensors, distributors, and suppliers for property damage exceed $100.

BECAUSE EACH END-USER SYSTEM IS CUSTOMIZED AND DIFFERS FROM NI\u8242?S TESTING PLATFORMS AND BECAUSE A USER OR APPLICATION DESIGNER MAY USE NI PRODUCTS IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER PRODUCTS IN A MANNER NOT EVALUATED OR CONTEMPLATED BY NI, THE USER OR APPLICATION DESIGNER IS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR VERIFYING AND VALIDATING THE SUITABILITY OF NI PRODUCTS WHENEVER NI PRODUCTS ARE INCORPORATED IN A SYSTEM OR APPLICATION, INCLUDING THE APPROPRIATE DESIGN, PROCESS, AND SAFETY LEVEL OF SUCH SYSTEM OR APPLICATION. \b0\f2\fs22\par
